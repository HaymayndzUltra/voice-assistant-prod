=== P1.1 Translation Services Performance Snapshot ===
Timestamp: Sun Aug  3 02:00:57 PST 2025
Uptime Analysis:
- nllb_adapter: 19+ hours (POTENTIAL HOTSPOT - long running)
- fixed_streaming_translation: Recently restarted (suspicious)
- Supporting services: redis_translation, nats_translation (19+ hours)

Key Findings:
1. fixed_streaming_translation was recently restarted (possible crash/restart due to performance issue)
2. nllb_adapter has been running for 19+ hours continuously
3. Supporting infrastructure (Redis, NATS) stable

Next Steps (P1.2):
- Correlate resource usage with incoming request rates
- Monitor nllb_adapter for CPU/memory hotspots
- Check for memory leaks in long-running nllb_adapter

Evidence for Defect Ticket (P1.4):
- Container restart pattern indicates instability
- Need to monitor for resource exhaustion patterns
