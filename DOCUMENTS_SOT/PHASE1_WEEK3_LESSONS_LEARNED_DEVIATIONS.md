# PHASE 1 WEEK 3: LESSONS LEARNED & DEVIATIONS

**Phase:** Phase 1 Week 3 - Prometheus Monitoring Rollout
**Generated:** 2024-07-23

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

- **Integrated Optimization & Monitoring:** Integrating performance optimization directly with the monitoring rollout created a powerful feedback loop, allowing for immediate validation of improvements (e.g., the 29.2% gain).
- **Holistic Infrastructure Approach:** A holistic infrastructure approach (monitoring, service discovery, optimization framework) delivers more significant and sustainable value than deploying individual features in isolation.

## DEVIATIONS

- **Cross-Machine Coordination Test:** A cross-machine coordination test for the ObservabilityHub was conducted while hubs were offline. This test needs to be re-executed under normal operating conditions to be fully validated.
