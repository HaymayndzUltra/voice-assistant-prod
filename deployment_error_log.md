# Deployment Error Log

## Phase 2-B Execution Failure

**Date**: 2025-01-30 07:51 UTC
**Phase**: 2-B - Monolithic Build Workflow
**Step**: Building base images

### Error Description
Cannot execute Docker build commands because the execution environment is already inside a Docker container.

### Environment Details
- Running inside container: `1f9376d1931a774ddfaed5ca595018f912597861d5bf6b18e1eae5587dac380d`
- Docker command not available in container
- Unable to proceed with deployment plan as written

### Required Resolution
The deployment plan needs to be executed from a host system with Docker installed, not from within a container. Alternatives:
1. Execute from the host system directly
2. Set up Docker-in-Docker (requires privileged container)
3. Use remote Docker daemon via DOCKER_HOST
4. Modify deployment strategy to work within container constraints

### Impact
- Cannot build Docker images
- Cannot push to registry
- Cannot deploy services
- All subsequent phases blocked

**STATUS**: BLOCKED - Requires environment change
