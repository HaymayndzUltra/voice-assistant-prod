# 🔧 Long Task Chunking Solution
**Date:** 2025-07-29  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## 🎯 Problem Identified

### **User Feedback:**
*"pakiayos kase minsan pag naguutos ako sobrang haba tulad niyan hndi na chunked ng maayos"*

**Translation:** "Please fix because sometimes when I give orders they're too long like that, they're not chunked properly"

### **Current Issue:**
- **Very long task descriptions** (1000+ characters)
- **Poor chunking** results in meaningless TODO items
- **Task IDs** become truncated and unreadable
- **User experience** suffers from unclear task breakdown

## 📊 Problem Analysis

### **Current Long Task Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "20250728T211603_alwaysApply:_truedescription:_|__SYSTEM_CONTEXT:__",
  "description": "alwaysApply: truedescription: |  SYSTEM_CONTEXT:    - Multi-agent, multi-container AI system (70+ Python agents)    - Two subsystems:        - MainPC: RTX 4090, Ubuntu, agents in main_pc_code/agents/, main_pc_code/FORMAINPC/        - PC2: RTX 3060, low CPU Ubuntu, agents in pc2_code/agents/    - Agents and dependencies defined in:        - main_pc_code/config/startup_config.yaml (MainPC)        - pc2_code/config/startup_config.yaml (PC2)    - Shared libraries: common/, common_utils/, etc.  OBJECTIVE:    - Perform a complete, clean, and dependency-correct Docker/PODMAN refactor for the entire system.    - Delete all existing Docker/Podman containers, images, and compose files.    - Generate a new Source of Truth (SoT) docker-compose setup, with logical agent grouping, correct dependency order, and optimized requirements per container.    - Ensure that each container only installs/downloads what is strictly necessary for its agents.    - Proactively analyze and resolve all dependency, timing, and startup order issues.  CONSTRAINTS:    - No redundant downloads or oversized images.    - All agent dependencies must be satisfied per container, but nothing extra.    - Startup order must respect agent interdependencies (e.g., core services before dependents).    - Group agents in containers by logical function and dependency, not just by subsystem.    - Maintain clear separation between MainPC and PC2, but allow for shared service containers if optimal.  PHASES:    - Phase 1: System Analysis & Cleanup        - Inventory all existing Docker/Podman containers, images, and compose files.        - Delete all old containers/images/compose files.        - Identify all agent groups, dependencies, and required libraries.    - Phase 2: Logical Grouping & Compose Generation        - Design optimal container groupings (by function, dependency, resource needs).        - Generate new docker-compose SoT with correct build contexts, volumes, networks, and healthchecks.        - Ensure requirements.txt per container is minimal and correct.    - Phase 3: Validation & Optimization        - Build and start all containers in dependency-correct order.        - Validate agent startup, health, and inter-container communication.        - Optimize for image size, startup time, and resource usage.        - Document the new architecture and compose setup.  MEMORY & REPORTING:    - Persist all actions, decisions, and SoT changes to MCP memory and memory-bank/*.md.    - Log all deletions, groupings, and compose generation steps.    - Escalate to user if ambiguous dependency or grouping is detected.success_criteria:  - All legacy Docker/Podman artifacts deleted.  - New SoT docker-compose file(s) generated and validated.  - All agents run with only their required dependencies.  - Startup order and healthchecks are correct.  - Full logs and memory updates available for audit.awaiting_go_signal: true",

### **Issues with Current Chunking:**
1. **❌ Task ID truncated** - `alwaysApply:_truedescription:_|__SYSTEM_CONTEXT:__`
2. **❌ Meaningless chunks** - "Ubuntu", "agents in main_pc_code/agents/"
3. **❌ No logical structure** - Random text splitting
4. **❌ Poor readability** - Hard to understand what each TODO does

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### **1. Improved Task Chunker (`improved_task_chunker.py`)**

#### **Features:**
- ✅ **Priority keyword splitting** (PHASE, OBJECTIVE, CONSTRAINTS, etc.)
- ✅ **Sentence-based chunking** for natural breaks
- ✅ **Phrase-based chunking** for very long sentences
- ✅ **Smart description extraction** for readable task names
- ✅ **Philippines time integration**

#### **Chunking Strategy:**
```python
def chunk_long_task(self, task_description: str) -> List[str]:
    # Step 1: Split by priority keywords first
    chunks = self._split_by_priority_keywords(task_description)
    
    # Step 2: If still too long, split by sentences
    if any(len(chunk) > self.max_chunk_length for chunk in chunks):
        chunks = self._split_by_sentences(task_description)
    
    # Step 3: If still too long, split by phrases
    if any(len(chunk) > self.max_chunk_length for chunk in chunks):
        chunks = self._split_by_phrases(task_description)
    
    # Step 4: Clean and validate chunks
    chunks = self._clean_chunks(chunks)
```

### **2. Quick Fix Script (`fix_long_task.py`)**

#### **Features:**
- ✅ **Immediate fix** for current long task
- ✅ **Smart description creation** from OBJECTIVE section
- ✅ **Logical chunking** by priority keywords
- ✅ **Philippines time** integration

### **3. Enhanced Task Structure**

#### **Improved Task Format:**
```json

  "description": "Docker/PODMAN Refactor: Perform a complete, clean, and dependency-correct Docker/PODMAN refactor for the entire system",
