# Phase 2 Strategy Summary (auto-generated)

Total requirements files analyzed: 125
Total unique packages found: 225
Packages occurring in >=10 containers: 19
Version conflicts detected: 77

## Next Steps
1. Promote `requirements.common.txt` as a base layer in Docker multi-stage builds.
2. Resolve version conflicts listed in `phase2_requirements_analysis.json`.
3. Group containers by profile similarity (ML, API, Utility) based on requirements.
4. Update Dockerfiles to `COPY requirements.common.txt` first for layer caching.
5. Use `pip-tools` to compile locked .txt files per container.
6. Adopt automated security scanning (safety) in CI.
