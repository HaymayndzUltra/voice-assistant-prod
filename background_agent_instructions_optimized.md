# COMPREHENSIVE DUAL-MACHINE AI SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION & VALIDATION

Claude, execute a comprehensive optimization and validation audit of this dual-machine AI system with the following critical requirements:

## SYSTEM CONTEXT:
- 77 total containerized agents (54 MainPC + 23 PC2)
- MainPC: RTX 4090 with power GPU processing
- PC2: RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM) hitting performance limits
- Recent migration to individual containers per agent
- Cross-machine ZMQ communication architecture
- Critical performance bottlenecks and technical debt identified

## PHASE 1 - CONTAINER VALIDATION & BUILD OPTIMIZATION:

### 1.0 MANDATORY SYSTEM DISCOVERY (RUN FIRST):
**CRITICAL: Execute this before any other analysis!**

```bash
# Run the system discovery script to map the complete file structure
python system_discovery_script.py

# This will generate:
# - system_discovery_report.json (complete system mapping)
# - analysis_paths.json (specific file paths for analysis)
```

**The background agent MUST start with system discovery to know exactly where all files are located!**

### 1.1 SYSTEM DISCOVERY & CONTAINER ANALYSIS:
1. **Complete File System Mapping:**
   ```bash
   # Primary locations to scan:
   ./docker/                                    # 77 Docker containers
   ./main_pc_code/agents/                      # MainPC agent source code
   ./pc2_code/agents/                          # PC2 agent source code
   ./common/                                   # Shared utilities and base classes
   ./phase1_implementation/                    # Phase implementation code
   ./scripts/                                  # Build and utility scripts
   ./requirements*.txt                         # Root-level requirements
