2. **pyzmq:** 23 services (29%) 
3. **pydantic:** 14 services (18%)
4. **numpy:** 14 services (18%)
5. **redis:** 7 services (9%)

### Optimization Opportunities
- **Shared Base Images:** Can reduce build times and disk usage
- **Dependency Deduplication:** 40 unique packages across 78 services
- **Multi-stage Builds:** Recommended for services with compiled dependencies

## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### Missing Health Checks (15 services)
Services without healthcheck configurations:
- code_generator, empathy_agent, executor
- human_awareness, knowledge_base, memory_client
- mood_tracker, predictive_health_monitor, scripts
- session_memory_agent, shared, tone_detector
- translation_services, voice_profiling, vram_optimizer

### Missing Core Files (6 services)
- **Missing Dockerfile:** scripts, shared, translation_services
- **Missing docker-compose.yml:** scripts, shared, translation_services

### Large Images
- **pc2_infra_core:** 6.77GB (exceeds 3GB threshold)
- **Unnamed images:** Multiple large images requiring cleanup

## üí° Top 5 Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Standardize Base Images (Priority: HIGH)
- **CPU Services (77):** Migrate to `python:3.10-slim-bullseye`
- **GPU Services (4):** Standardize on `nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-runtime-ubuntu22.04` 
- **Estimated Savings:** ~65% image size reduction for CPU services

### 2. Add Missing Health Checks (Priority: HIGH)
- **Affected:** 15 services
- **Implementation:** Add `HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:PORT/health || exit 1`
- **Benefit:** Improved container orchestration and monitoring

### 3. Enable Pip Cache Optimization (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Affected:** All services
- **Implementation:** Use `--build-arg PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1` and `--no-cache-dir`
- **Benefit:** Reduced layer bloat and faster builds

### 4. Implement Multi-Stage Builds (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Affected:** Services with compiled dependencies (PyTorch, etc.)
- **Implementation:** Builder stage ‚Üí Runtime stage
- **Benefit:** Remove unused toolchains from final images

### 5. Pin Version Tags (Priority: LOW)
- **Affected:** 3 services using :latest
- **Implementation:** Replace `:latest` with specific version tags
- **Benefit:** Deterministic builds and improved security

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1)
1. Add missing Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files
2. Implement health checks for 15 affected services
3. Address large image issues (pc2_infra_core optimization)

### Phase 2: Optimization (Week 2-3)
1. Migrate CPU services to slim base images
2. Standardize GPU base images
3. Implement pip cache optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Week 4)
1. Multi-stage build migration for heavy services
2. Dependency consolidation and shared layers
3. Final security and version pinning

## üìà Expected Outcomes

### Image Size Reduction
- **CPU Services:** ~65% reduction (average 300MB ‚Üí 105MB)
- **Total Storage Savings:** Estimated 2-3GB across all services
- **Build Time Improvement:** 20-30% faster builds with shared bases

### Reliability Improvement
- **Health Monitoring:** 100% services with proper health checks
- **Deterministic Builds:** All services using pinned versions
- **Security:** Reduced attack surface with slim images

### Operational Benefits
- **Standardization:** Consistent base images across service types
- **Monitoring:** Complete health check coverage
- **Maintainability:** Simplified Dockerfile patterns

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Execute Remediation Plan:** Address critical issues first
2. **Implement Monitoring:** Track image sizes and build times
3. **Establish Standards:** Document Dockerfile best practices
4. **Continuous Optimization:** Regular audits and improvements
