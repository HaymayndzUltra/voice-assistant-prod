### PHASE 2: Optimization Strategy & Recommendations ✅
- [x] Dependency analysis completed
- [x] Base image recommendations implemented
- [x] All 5 optimization recommendations applied:
  - ✅ CPU images → python:3.10-slim-bullseye
  - ✅ GPU images → nvidia/cuda:12.3.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04  
  - ✅ Healthchecks added to all services
  - ✅ Dockerignore files added for build optimization
  - ✅ Duplicate services cleaned up

### PHASE 3: Automation Scripting & Tool Generation ✅
- [x] Bootstrap audit script available
- [x] Structural integrity scanner working
- [x] Agent coverage analysis script fixed
- [x] Optimization scripts created and executed

### PHASE 4: Execution & Artifact Review ✅

- [x] Build logs generated (mainpc_test_20250805_101429.log)
- [x] Optimization report created
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Agent coverage script rewritten from scratch
  - **BEFORE**: 0% coverage (broken hardcoded fantasy list)
  - **AFTER**: 59.2% coverage (45 real agents detected)

### PHASE 5: Finalization & Branch Merge 🔄
- [x] All changes committed to audit branch
- [x] Remediation completed successfully
- [ ] **PENDING**: Peer review and merge

## 🔧 CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. Agent Coverage Analysis Script ⚠️→✅
**Problem**: Script was completely broken with hardcoded fantasy list of 44 non-existent agents
**Solution**: Completely rewrote script to scan actual docker-compose.yml files
**Result**: Now correctly detects 45 real agents across 45 services

### 2. Duplicate Folder Cleanup ✅
**Problem**: 5 duplicate agent folders causing confusion
**Solution**: Analyzed and removed duplicates while preserving functionality  
**Result**: Clean structure (76 services instead of 81)

### 3. Missing Healthchecks ✅
**Problem**: Some services missing healthcheck configurations
**Solution**: Automated script added healthchecks to all services
**Result**: 100% compliance

### 4. Image Base Standardization ✅
**Problem**: Inconsistent base images across services
**Solution**: Migrated CPU to python:3.10-slim-bullseye, GPU to cuda:12.3.0
**Result**: Standardized infrastructure
