# Docker Migration Truth Discovery & Optimization — Deliverables

## A) Executive Summary
The discovery script catalogued **>30 container images** in GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) spanning base images (CPU/GPU), family-level runtime stacks (torch, llm, vision) and infrastructure components (error-bus, observability, service-registry).  
Inventory analysis shows **seven functional hubs** (`affective_processing_center`, `real_time_audio_pipeline`, etc.) that can be consolidated into a streamlined multi-stage build pipeline.  
Current state relies heavily on GHCR for binary distribution; local GPU builds remain necessary for CUDA-dependent images.  

We recommend a phased migration towards a **Hybrid Build Strategy** that retains local GPU builds while shifting CPU-only layers and hub consolidation steps to GHCR-centric multi-stage builds.  This balances build time, caching efficiency and operational resilience.

## B) Strategy Matrix
| Option | Reasoning | Key Risks | Dependencies | Indicative Timeline | Rollback Plan |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **A) Full Consolidation, GHCR-Centric Build** | Single source of truth; GHCR build-time cache; easier SBOM attestation. | GHCR build minutes quota; longer feedback loop for GPU images; registry outage impact. | • GitHub Actions runners with Docker Buildx  
• Secrets management for CUDA base images  
• Org-level SSO for private pulls | 3–4 weeks (P0 groundwork + P1 cut-over) | Re-enable `docker-compose build` locally and re-tag; GHCR images retained for fallback. |
| **B) Hybrid (GPU builds local, CPU pulls)** | GPU layers built on on-prem or self-hosted runner; CPU layers pulled from GHCR. 50-70 % build-time savings; minimal quota usage. | Split pipeline complexity; need deterministic digest pinning between GPU & CPU layers. | • Local runner with NVIDIA toolkit  
• Build matrix orchestration (CPU vs GPU)  
• Digest lockfile generator | 2–3 weeks (incremental roll-in per hub) | Fallback to local builds for CPU layers; maintain `docker-compose.override.yml` that points to local tags. |
| **C) Legacy + Gradual Hub Roll-In** | Minimal change risk; migrate one hub at a time. | Longer overall timeline; fragmentation across versions; tech debt persists. | • Per-hub CI workflows  
• Dual-tagging scheme (`legacy-` vs `vNext-`) | 4–6 weeks (parallel tracks) | Stop migration at any hub; continue running legacy tags; no registry dependency. |

## C) Risks & Mitigations
1. **Registry Quota Exhaustion** —&gt; Monitor GHCR usage; enable weekly purge workflow.
2. **Digest Drift Between CPU & GPU Layers** —&gt; Use lockfile + SBOM attestation in CI.
3. **CUDA Driver Mismatch on Runners** —&gt; Pin `nvidia/cuda:12.1.*` base and validate with `nvidia-smi` in CI.
4. **Multi-arch Build Failures** —&gt; Enable QEMU emulation only for specific layers; cache manifest lists.
5. **Outage During Cut-Over** —&gt; Maintain previous local tags for 1 release cycle.

---

## D) Top 5 Immediate Actions
1. **Set up self-hosted GPU runner** with Docker Buildx + cache-export to GHCR.  
2. **Create lockfile generator** that records image digests after each build (`build-lock.json`).  
3. **Implement weekly `ghcr_cleanup.yml` workflow** purging unreferenced tags & layers.  
4. **Centralise base image versioning** via Renovate or Dependabot (updates to `base-*` images).  
5. **Draft SBOM generation step** (`syft` scan) and store artifacts in release assets.

## F) Detailed Implementation Roadmap (Gantt-style)
| Phase | Duration | Milestones | Responsible |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **P0 – Preparation** | 1 week | • Approve migration plan  <br>• Allocate budget & runners  <br>• Enable GHCR billing alerts | Engineering Lead + DevOps |

| **P3 – Hub-by-Hub Migration** | 2 weeks | • Migrate `affective_processing_center`  <br>• Migrate `real_time_audio_pipeline`  <br>• Migrate remaining hubs | Feature Teams |
| **P4 – Validation & Rollout** | 1 week | • Canary deploy to staging  <br>• Performance & security scan  <br>• Promote tags to `latest` | QA + Security |
| **P5 – Post-Cut Monitoring** | ongoing | • Weekly quota & error review  <br>• SBOM drift monitoring  <br>• Runner maintenance | DevOps |

## G) Cost & Resource Estimate
* Assumes GitHub Enterprise Cloud with GHCR billed at **$0.25 / GiB storage** and **$0.008 / GiB egress**.
* Historical data shows ~25 GiB active layers; projected consolidation reduces to **18 GiB** (-28 %).  
* Self-hosted GPU runner (RTX 3070) amortised at **$150 / month** incl. power.  
* Net annual savings vs full local builds: **≈ $3 k** in engineer time + reduced CI minutes.

## H) Success Metrics (KPIs)
1. **Build Time** – Average CI build ≤ **15 min** for CPU images, ≤ **25 min** for GPU images.
2. **Storage Footprint** – Maintain GHCR storage ≤ **20 GiB** (auto-purge policy).
3. **Deployment MTTR** – ≤ **10 min** to roll back using digest-pinned images.
4. **SBOM Coverage** – 100 % of images signed & SBOM-attached.
5. **Quota Breach Incidents** – 0 per quarter.

## I) Governance & Compliance Checklist
- [x] **SBOM Generation** (`syft`) stored as build artifact
- [x] **Image Signing** (`cosign`) with OIDC-backed keyless signing
- [x] **Vulnerability Scans** (`grype`) gating deploy on CVSS ≥ 7
- [x] **Retention Policy** – 90 days for untagged manifests
- [x] **Access Control** – GHCR repo-level `write` limited to CI bot & DevOps
