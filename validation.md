Validation Report — Hard Delete Review

- Repo scan time: $(date is not embedded; see terminal logs for git state)

Findings
- hard_delete dataset: NOT FOUND (searched for files/keys matching: hard_delete, hard-delete, to_delete, delete_list)
- evidence.json: NOT FOUND (searched patterns: evidence.json, evidence*.json)
- keeplist.txt: NOT FOUND (searched patterns: keeplist.txt, keeplist*.txt)

Requested Checks
- Count of hard_delete entries with score < 5: 0
  - Rationale: No hard_delete entries discovered in the repository; empty set implies count 0.

- 10 random samples from hard_delete with their test results from evidence.json:
  - N/A — No hard_delete dataset or evidence.json available. Samples cannot be produced.

- Confirmation that keeplist.txt entries are preserved:
  - Unknown — keeplist file not found during scan. Cannot verify preservation.

Evidence of Search (high level)
- Ran repository-wide searches for: evidence.json, keeplist.txt, hard_delete, hard-delete, to_delete, delete_list
- Inspected task and cleanup areas under: /workspace, /workspace/memory-bank, /workspace/cleanup, tools/*
- Found only function references to hard_delete_task in task tooling; no list/dataset of paths targeted for deletion was present.

Recommended Next Steps (non-executing)
- Provide the path(s) to the following inputs if they exist in another workspace or artifact store:
  - The hard_delete manifest (JSON or text) with fields: path and score
  - evidence.json containing per-path test results
  - keeplist.txt enumerating files that must be preserved
- Once available, re-run this validation to populate samples and preservation checks.

Security/SRE Alignment
- No filesystem modifications were executed.
- This report is analysis-only and documents missing inputs and current zero-count outcome for < 5 scores.
