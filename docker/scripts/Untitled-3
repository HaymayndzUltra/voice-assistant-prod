Realistically speaking, my experience with o3 is that it’s great at troubleshooting or finding errors that Sonnet 4 or GPT 4.1 spend forever on or just can’t solve. Of course understanding structure, tools, and prompting matters - again comes down to your skills and prompt engineering.
But I only use it for finding complex logic errors and fixing those specifically. Outside of that, I don’t find it more useful for regular tasks - I prefer Sonnet 4 or GPT 4.1 in those cases. In my experience with continuous tasks, o3 fails more often or can’t stick to what I’m asking, although the recent updates with To-dos made it better at staying on topic.
Even better workflow is using o3 to find all the errors, identify and analyze root problems, build a plan on how to fix it, then let regular agents implement it - basically not wasting too much credits. With proper prompts I’ve managed to use auto sometimes to complete fixes based on o3’s feedback on the issue.
Still, for continuous work or regular daily use I stick with Sonnet 4 or GPT 4.1, and only pull out o3 when I’m stuck or need feedback on logical errors that normal agents can’t handle.
Regarding o3-Pro, I haven’t found any use cases where I need it in my experience. Regular o3 was more than enough and o3-Pro pretty much gave similar results but way more costly. But I also don’t develop complex apps.

Apart from this being an LLM thread, O3 is good for planning, and better for revising plans from Gemini Pro / Sonnet 4 Thinking. Will give it a go to 1-pass planning.

I honestly don’t know what the rage for o3 is about for complex programming tasks it performs horribly.
Compared to what models? And for what programming tasks? I think O3 does best for planning and backend, whereas the Sonic models do way better for frontend.

I have no idea what sonic models are. o3 has not helped with anything i do in the backend.

I used o3 a few times now due to necessity (being rate-limited on sonnet 4).
It is true that it does indeed work very well sometimes for complex problems. I am a big fan of sonnet 4, but o3 have solved a problem twice for me now in one go where sonnet 4 (or gemini) could not.
I still prefer sonnet 4 a million times more as it adheres much better to prompts overall and does a great job with almost all tasks/requests, but o3 can be surprisingly good for specific problems. The tool call is hit/miss, most annoyingly it seems quite lazy, if you request it to do several things it will many times do half of it. Not recommended for normal usage imo, but can be great for problem solving.

Claude sonnet 4 is my first choice because its better at long term step iteration… o3 pro is too expensive just like opus for me. but i guess for single shot hard problems its worth it.
but for hard problems i suggest you use max mode, sonnet 4 and sequential thinking mcp… ■■■■■■■■ combo
