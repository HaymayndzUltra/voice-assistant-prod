# Next Steps for AI System Containerization

This document outlines the next steps to complete the containerization of the AI System using Podman.

## Completed Tasks

✅ Created base Dockerfile with CUDA support for RTX 4090  
✅ Created requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies  
✅ Created podman_build.sh script to build and run containers  
✅ Created README.md with usage instructions  
✅ Created environment file template  
✅ Created GPU test script  
✅ Created PC2 connectivity test script  
✅ Created containerization report  

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Base Image Build**
   - Run `./podman_build.sh` to build the base image
   - Verify that the image builds successfully
   - Test GPU access in the container

2. **Test Container Group Builds**
   - Build each container group
   - Verify that the images are tagged correctly
   - Test GPU access in GPU-enabled containers

3. **Configure Network Settings**
   - Update the network_config.yaml file with the correct IP addresses
   - Test connectivity between containers
   - Test connectivity to PC2 services

4. **Test Agent Startup**
   - Start each container group
   - Verify that agents start correctly
   - Check agent health status

5. **Test Cross-Machine Communication**
   - Start PC2 services
   - Run the PC2 connectivity test script
   - Verify that MainPC can communicate with PC2 services

6. **Performance Tuning**
   - Monitor container resource usage
   - Adjust container resource limits as needed
   - Optimize GPU memory usage

7. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update documentation with any changes made during testing
   - Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Document performance tuning recommendations

## Known Issues to Address

1. **GPU Memory Management**
   - Multiple containers accessing the GPU may need manual memory management
   - Consider implementing a GPU memory allocation service

2. **ZMQ Socket Binding**
   - Ensure that ZMQ sockets are properly bound and connected
   - Check for port conflicts

3. **Container Startup Order**
   - Ensure that containers are started in the correct order
   - Consider implementing a container orchestration solution
