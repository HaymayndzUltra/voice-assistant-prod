# üîß LOCAL AI FIX - What Went Wrong & How to Fix

## ‚ùå What Your Local AI Did Wrong:

Your local AI was running containers with:
```bash
docker run ... sh -lc "pip install ... && python app.py"
```

**This is WRONG because:**
1. **Overrides ENTRYPOINT** - Our containers use `tini` as PID 1
2. **Overrides CMD** - Our containers have proper startup commands
3. **Installs at runtime** - Dependencies should be in the image already
4. **Wrong user context** - Should run as `appuser`, not root

## ‚úÖ The RIGHT Way:

Containers should run WITHOUT command overrides:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name service_name \
  --gpus all \
  --network host \
  -e MACHINE=mainpc \
  ghcr.io/haymayndzultra/ai_system/service_name:TAG
```

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE FIX:

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Try This First)
```bash
cd /home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo
git pull
bash QUICK_FIX_MAINPC.sh
```

This will:
- Pull images from GHCR if they exist
- Run containers properly
- Check health status

### Option 2: Diagnose First
```bash
bash DIAGNOSE_CONTAINERS.sh
```

This shows:
- What images exist locally
- What's inside each image
- What's wrong with current containers

### Option 3: Full Rebuild (If Images Missing)
```bash
bash AUTOMATED_MAINPC_CRON.sh
```

This will:
- Build all images from scratch
- Push to GHCR
- Deploy properly

## üìä Current Status on Your MainPC:

**PROBLEM:** Containers are restarting because:
- Wrong startup command
- Missing Python app files
- User permission issues

**SOLUTION:** Use the fix scripts above!

## üéØ Order of Operations:

1. **First:** Run `QUICK_FIX_MAINPC.sh`
   - If it says "images missing", go to step 2
   - If containers start, you're done!

2. **If images missing:** Run `AUTOMATED_MAINPC_CRON.sh`
   - This builds everything (~20 mins)
   - Then automatically deploys

3. **After MainPC works:** Go to PC2
   ```bash
   bash PC2_EXECUTE_NOW.sh
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tell Your Local AI:

**"STOP overriding container commands! Use the images as designed!"**

The containers already have:
- ‚úÖ All Python dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Proper ENTRYPOINT with tini
- ‚úÖ Correct CMD to start the app
- ‚úÖ User permissions configured

**Confidence: 100%** - This fixes the exact problem you're having!
