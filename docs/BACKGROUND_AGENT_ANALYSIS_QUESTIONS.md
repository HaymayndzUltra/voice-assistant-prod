- Bottlenecks and single points of failure

### **Q12: Port Allocation and Patterns**
**Question**: Which agents share similar port ranges/patterns?

**Expected Outcome**:
- Port allocation map for all 84 agents
- Conflicts and overlaps between MainPC/PC2
- Patterns in port assignment (7xxx for MainPC, 8xxx for PC2)
- Available port ranges for future expansion

### **Q13: ZMQ/Redis Usage Patterns**
**Question**: What are the actual ZMQ/Redis usage patterns in the system?

**Expected Outcome**:
- Agents using direct ZMQ vs connection pools
- Redis usage: direct connections vs pool usage
- Message patterns (req/rep, pub/sub, push/pull)
- Connection lifecycle management approaches

## üìä **CRITICAL SYSTEM HEALTH**

### **Q14: Health Check Implementation Status**
**Question**: Which agents have working health checks vs broken ones?

**Expected Outcome**:
- List of agents with functional health endpoints
