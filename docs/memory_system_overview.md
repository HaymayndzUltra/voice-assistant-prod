# ðŸ§  Memory System â€“ Feature Overview & Developer Guide

*Version: 1.0 â€“ generated automatically*

---

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes the major capabilities that were implemented while executing the *2025-01-22 Strategic Directive* to evolve the legacy memory workflow into a fully-fledged **Memory System** package.

The system is designed for **ephemeral developer environments** (Cursor, Codespaces, Gitpod) but remains portable to any Python 3.8+ runtime.

---

## 2. Key Features

| Area | Feature | File / Module |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Packaging** | Installable package skeleton (`memory_system/â€¦`) with Domain / Service / Interface layers | `memory_system/__init__.py` |
| **Unified CLI** | `memoryctl` entry-point with sub-commands: `tcc`, `run`, `migrate` | `memory_system/cli.py` |
| **Interactive UI** | Task Command Center (TCC) with added *Intelligent Task Execution* option | `task_command_center.py` |
| **Workflow Intelligence** | Complexity analysis, action-item extraction, adaptive memory loading, smart execution | `workflow_memory_intelligence.py` |
| **Async Task Engine** | Native-async concurrent task runner (`memoryctl run â€¦`) | `memory_system/services/async_task_engine.py` |
| **Telemetry** | JSON-line events: `*_start`, `*_end`, `*_error`, duration captured via `span()` | `memory_system/services/telemetry.py` |
| **Structured Logging** | Root logger emits single-line JSON records | `memory_system/logger.py` |
| **Memory Providers** | Pluggable abstraction â€“ FileSystem (default) & SQLite prototypes | `memory_system/services/memory_provider.py` |
| **Migration Utility** | `memoryctl migrate --to sqlite` to import markdown memories into SQLite | `memory_system/scripts/migrate_memories.py` |
| **Evolution Blueprint** | Architectural roadmap & milestones | `memory-bank/evolution_blueprint.md` |

## 3. Installation

```bash
# From repo root
pip install -e .  # Editable install
```

This registers the `memoryctl` command globally.

---

## 4. Command-Line Usage

### 4.1 Launch Task Command Center

```bash
memoryctl tcc
```

*New option:* `10. ðŸ§  Intelligent Task Execution` â€“ routes tasks through the workflow intelligence pipeline.

### 4.2 Run Tasks Concurrently (Async Engine)

```bash
memoryctl run --workers 4 "Refactor todo_manager.py" "Write unit tests for async engine"
```

Telemetry events and a JSON summary are printed when done.

### 4.3 Migrate Memories to SQLite

```bash
memoryctl migrate --to sqlite
export MEMORY_PROVIDER=sqlite  # Optional: switch provider at runtime
```

---

## 5. Telemetry & Logging

* **Telemetry** â€“ use `memory_system.services.telemetry.span()` to wrap any block and emit events.
* **Logging** â€“ call `memory_system.logger.setup()` to enable JSON logging. CLI does this automatically.

Sample event:
```json
{"ts": 1753709647.039, "event": "task_end", "duration": 0.0051, "description": "Perform deep scan"}
```

---

## 6. Memory Providers

### 6.1 FileSystem Provider (default)
* Scans `memory-bank/*.md` using regex search.

### 6.2 SQLite Provider
* Stores memories in `memory-bank/memory.db`.
* Simple `LIKE` search; candidate for FTS-5 upgrade.

Switch provider via environment variable:
```bash
export MEMORY_PROVIDER=sqlite
```

---

## 7. Developer Notes

* **Async Execution** â€“ `SmartTaskExecutionManager.execute_task_async()` provides awaitable execution; Async Task Engine orchestrates concurrency with a semaphore, no custom thread pool.
* **Backwards Compatibility** â€“ legacy scripts continue to work because default provider remains FileSystem and CLI flags preserve old behaviour.
* **Extensibility** â€“ new providers can implement the `MemoryProvider` protocol and register in `get_provider()`.

---

## 8. Future Work

1. **CI Pipeline** â€“ GitHub Actions for black, mypy, pytest-cov.
2. **Vector Store Integration** â€“ add semantic search provider (e.g., Chroma / Qdrant).
3. **Monitoring Dashboard** â€“ `memoryctl monitor --watch` TUI for real-time task / telemetry view.
4. **Domain Migration** â€“ relocate `todo_manager.py` et al. into `memory_system.services` namespace.
