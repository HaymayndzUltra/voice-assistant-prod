## TOOL USAGE GUARANTEE

For any phase execution or completion, the following sequence is MANDATORY:

1) Discovery/Verification before action:
```bash
python3 plan_next.py
python3 plain_hier.py <TASK_ID>
```

2) Execute sub-step(s) as indicated by the plan preview:
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py exec <TASK_ID> <SUB_INDEX>
```

3) Show current status to confirm progress:
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py show <TASK_ID>
```

4) When a phase's sub-steps are all complete, finalize:
```bash
python3 todo_manager.py done <TASK_ID> <PHASE_INDEX>
```

5) Post-action verification:
```bash
python3 plan_next.py
```

These steps are required to avoid missed "done" transitions and to keep the plan in sync.
