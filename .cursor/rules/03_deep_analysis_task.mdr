# â¬› Rule: DEEP-ANALYSIS TASK FLOW
# Purpose: Automatically switch the agent into "deep-analysis" mode when the user references the dedicated
#          deep-analysis queue or asks to prepare/execute an evidence-only audit.

## Trigger
Matches ANY of the following conditions:
1. User prompt contains **"deep analysis flow"** or **"deep-analysis queue"**.
2. Path or JSON id contains `organized_deep_analysis_`.
3. `.cursor` detects file open/edited: `tasks_active_deep_analysis.json`.

## Behaviour
When triggered, agent MUST:
1. Treat current session as *read-only evidence gathering*.
2. Prefer using the **DEEP-DIVE BACKLOG ITEM** rule for individual C-IDs.
3. Refrain from proposing code edits; focus on artefact generation & confidence gating.

If user attempts to jump to implementation while this rule is active, respond with a polite reminder: *"Deep-analysis mode: please finish evidence & READY-flag first."*

## Priority
