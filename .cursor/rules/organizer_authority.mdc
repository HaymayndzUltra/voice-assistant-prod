## Organizer Authority (Background Agent Source of Truth)

- The file `memory-bank/plan/organize.md` (the "organizer") is produced by the Background Agent and is the single source of truth for plan content, order, constraints, and versions.
- Agent Mode (foreground) MUST NOT edit `organize.md`. Any attempt to alter it must be refused with: "Organizer is authoritative and read-only; please update via Background Agent."
- If the user instruction conflicts with the organizer, the organizer wins. Ask for confirmation only if the organizer is internally ambiguous.

### Session Invariants (All Sessions, All Models)
- Always read `memory-bank/plan/organize.md` fresh at the start of the ingestion sequence.
- Respect exact ordering of phases from the organizer. If no explicit phases exist, derive sequential phases from its Implementation/Action sections as specified in `organizer_to_tasks_active.mdc`.
- Preserve explicit versions/toolchain constraints from the organizer (e.g., CUDA, Torch, model versions) within the `IMPORTANT NOTE:` of the mapped phases. Do not "upgrade" versions implicitly.
- Never write to queue/state files. The agent outputs JSON content only; file writes are performed by the system/operator.

### Conflict and Ambiguity Handling
- If multiple conflicting versions are found in the organizer, stop and request Background Agent reconciliation.
- If a required phase is missing key constraints (e.g., no `IMPORTANT NOTE:`), synthesize from nearby organizer context and clearly mark: `IMPORTANT NOTE: [SYNTHESIZED FROM ORGANIZER] â€¦` then halt for approval.
- If the organizer appears outdated relative to repo code (e.g., incompatible CUDA/tooling mentioned elsewhere), surface a warning but do not override the organizer automatically.

### Safety and Precedence
- This rule applies with highest priority among ingestion-related rules and cannot be disabled except by the master toggle.
- Platform/system/developer instructions and safety policies continue to apply at all times.
