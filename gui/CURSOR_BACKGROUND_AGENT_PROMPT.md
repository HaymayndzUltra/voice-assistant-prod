# ü§ñ Cursor Background Agent Integration Prompt

## üìã MISSION DIRECTIVE

I need you to analyze and integrate ALL placeholder functionality in the Modern GUI Control Center based on the comprehensive mapping in `@gui/GUI_INTEGRATION_MAP.md`.

**SCOPE:** Complete integration of all 68 buttons/features across 6 views, replacing ALL placeholder content with real backend functionality.

---

## üéØ PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (15 minutes)
1. **Thoroughly read and analyze `gui/GUI_INTEGRATION_MAP.md`**
2. **Identify all placeholder components** marked for integration
3. **Map integration priorities** (High/Medium/Low)
4. **Validate existing backend resources** (JSON files, CLI tools, etc.)

### Phase 2: Core Integration (2-3 hours)
**Execute systematic integration in this order:**

#### üî• HIGH PRIORITY (Critical Functionality):
1. **Task Management View** (`gui/views/task_management.py`)
   - Replace `_refresh_task_data()` placeholder with real JSON loading
   - Load: `tasks_active.json`, `tasks_queue.json`, `tasks_done.json`
   - Update treeview widgets with real task data
   - Implement task creation, queue controls

2. **Dashboard View** (`gui/views/dashboard.py`)
   - Real system stats (task counts, agent status)
   - Quick action buttons (New Task, Start/Pause Queue)
   - Live system status updates

3. **Automation Control** (`gui/views/automation_control.py`)
   - Queue engine start/stop controls
   - Auto-sync management integration
   - System automation settings

#### ‚ö° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhanced Features):
4. **Agent Control View** (`gui/views/agent_control.py`)
   - Real agent data from `agent_scan_results.json`
   - Agent health monitoring and controls
   - Port conflict detection

5. **Memory Intelligence** (`gui/views/memory_intelligence.py`)
   - Memory system CLI integration
   - Project brain navigation
   - Knowledge graph interface

6. **Monitoring View** (`gui/views/monitoring.py`)
   - System metrics with psutil
   - Real-time performance charts
   - Log viewing and export

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Testing (1 hour)
- Real-time auto-refresh implementation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX improvements

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Integration Guidelines:
```python
# Use existing backend tools:
- todo_manager.py functions for task operations
- queue_cli.py for queue management  
- agent_scan_results.json for agent data
- memory_system/cli.py for memory operations

# Follow patterns:
- Try/catch for all file operations
- JSON.loads() with error handling
- Treeview.delete() before inserting new data
- messagebox for user feedback

# REAL-TIME MONITORING LOGIC:
- threading.Timer for auto-refresh (30 seconds)
- os.path.getmtime() for file change detection
- queue.Queue for thread-safe UI updates
- after() method for UI thread safety

# ADVANCED ERROR HANDLING:
- Graceful degradation when files missing
- Fallback to cached data if available
- User notifications for system issues
- Debug logging with timestamp

# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Efficient treeview updates (batch operations)
- Memory cleanup for real-time data
- Background thread management
```

### File Structure to Maintain:
```
gui/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views/           # All view files to modify
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/        # system_service.py integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/          # Keep existing theming
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *.json files     # Backend data sources
```
