# üéØ PHASE 2 ACTION PLAN: RESILIENCE & MONITORING

## üìÖ TIMELINE: Weeks 4-8

## üéØ FOCUS: REDUNDANT OBSERVABILITY & SYSTEM RESILIENCE

### **SCOPE**
Deploy redundant ObservabilityHub, implement NATS JetStream, and enhance system resilience patterns.

### **RISKS ADDRESSED**
- F: ObservabilityHub SPOF (port 9000 choke-point) - **CRITICAL**
- B: Dependency graph edge-cases (PC2 deps causing socket hangs)

## üìã PLACEHOLDER - DETAILED PLAN TO BE CREATED

**STATUS**: üîÑ AWAITING PHASE 1 COMPLETION + DETAILED PLANNING

**PREREQUISITES**: Phase 1 successfully completed, all agents standardized

**NEXT ACTION**: After Phase 1 completion, re-read Background Agent guide and create detailed Week 4-8 implementation plan.

### **PLANNED DELIVERABLES**
- [ ] Redundant ObservabilityHub deployment (Central + Edge)
- [ ] NATS JetStream implementation for cross-machine sync
- [ ] Circuit breakers in RequestCoordinator
- [ ] Enhanced dependency graph validation
- [ ] Cross-machine failure scenario testing

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- Dual-hub architecture operational with failover
- NATS message bus handling cross-machine communication
- Zero single points of failure in monitoring
- Network partition scenarios handled gracefully
