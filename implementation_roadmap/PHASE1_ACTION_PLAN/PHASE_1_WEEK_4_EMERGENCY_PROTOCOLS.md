# PHASE 1 WEEK 4: EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS & ROLLBACK

**Phase:** Phase 1 Week 4 - High-Risk Agent Migration & Phase Completion
**Generated:** 2024-07-23

---

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

- **Fast rollback:** All changes delivered in single commit per agent; `git revert <sha>` + `supervisorctl restart <agent>`
- **Agent failure:** ServiceRegistry marks agent UNHEALTHY; RequestCoordinator circuit-breaks. Ops invoke `scripts/restart_agent.py <agent>`
- **Migration failure:** Rollback to previous agent version, restore config, restart agent, monitor health endpoints
- **Dual-Hub outage:** EdgeHub buffer keeps 5 min of metrics; CentralHub auto-replays on recovery
- **Escalation:** On sustained P1 (>10 min outage) escalate to Lead SRE, CTO, Vendor support

## SYSTEM RECOVERY STEPS

1. **Detect failure:** Automated monitoring/alerting triggers on agent or system health drop
2. **Isolate issue:** Identify affected agent(s) and root cause
3. **Rollback:** Use git revert and restart agent(s) as needed
4. **Validate recovery:** Confirm health endpoints, logs, and metrics return to normal
5. **Escalate if unresolved:** Follow escalation path for critical issues
