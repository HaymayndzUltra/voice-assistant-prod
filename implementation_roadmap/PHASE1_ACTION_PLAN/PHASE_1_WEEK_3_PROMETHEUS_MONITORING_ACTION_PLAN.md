**Description:** Metrics collection may impact system performance
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** High
**Mitigation:** 
- Gradual rollout with performance monitoring
- Immediate rollback capability via environment variable
- Performance baseline validation before full deployment

**Emergency Protocol:**
```bash
# Immediate performance degradation response (< 2 minutes)
export ENABLE_PROMETHEUS_METRICS=false
supervisorctl restart all
# Validate system returns to baseline performance
```

#### **RISK 2: ObservabilityHub Distributed Architecture Failure**
**Description:** Dual-hub architecture may cause data consistency issues
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Single hub fallback configuration ready
- Data synchronization validation before cutover
- Hub health monitoring with automatic failover

**Emergency Protocol:**
```bash
# Fallback to single Central hub (< 3 minutes)
python scripts/emergency_fallback_single_hub.py
# Redirect all agents to Central hub only
python scripts/redirect_agents_central_hub.py
```

#### **RISK 3: Optimization Deployment Cascade Failure**
**Description:** Multiple agent optimizations may cause system instability
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Batch deployment with validation checkpoints
- Individual agent rollback capability
- Performance monitoring during optimization

**Emergency Protocol:**
```bash
# System-wide optimization rollback (< 5 minutes)
python scripts/emergency_optimization_rollback.py --all-agents
# Restore all agents to pre-optimization state
git revert optimization_deployment_commits
supervisorctl restart all
```

### **COMMUNICATION & ESCALATION PROTOCOLS**

#### **ALERT LEVELS:**
- **GREEN:** Normal operations, no intervention required
- **YELLOW:** Performance degradation detected, monitoring increased
- **ORANGE:** Single component failure, fallback activated
- **RED:** System-wide issues, emergency protocols activated

#### **ESCALATION MATRIX:**
