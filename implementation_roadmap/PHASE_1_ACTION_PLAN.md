# üéØ PHASE 1 ACTION PLAN: STANDARDIZATION & BASEAGENT MIGRATION
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-4 (4 weeks)  
**Focus:** Path Management Standardization & BaseAgent Migration  
**Status:** DETAILED PLANNING COMPLETE

---

## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Goal:** Achieve 100% BaseAgent adoption and unified path management across all 77 agents  
**Scope:** Complete migration of 24 remaining legacy agents + path standardization  
**Agents Affected:** 24 legacy agents + 50+ agents with mixed path patterns  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (systematic changes with agent restarts required)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 100% agents inherit from BaseAgent (77/77 agents)
- [ ] Unified PathManager usage across all agents (eliminate path_env legacy)
- [ ] Comprehensive health check coverage (no agents bypass health monitoring)
- [ ] CI enforcement preventing path management regressions
- [ ] Zero functionality loss during migration

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

1. **Zero Downtime**: Rolling migration, never more than 3 agents down simultaneously
2. **Incremental Validation**: Each agent migrated individually with full testing
3. **Rollback Ready**: 5-minute maximum rollback time per agent
4. **Health Preservation**: All existing functionality must remain intact
5. **Documentation**: Migration patterns documented for future use

---

## üéØ PHASE 1 OBJECTIVES & RISK MITIGATION

### **Primary Objectives**
1. **Complete BaseAgent Migration**: 24 remaining legacy agents ‚Üí BaseAgent inheritance
2. **Path Management Unification**: Eliminate mixed path_env + PathManager usage  
3. **Health Check Standardization**: Ensure 100% health monitoring coverage
4. **CI Enforcement**: Prevent regressions in agent patterns

### **Risk Mitigation (Background Agent Priority)**
- **Risk D**: Partial BaseAgent adoption (Impact: 9/10, Complexity: 6/10)
- **Risk H**: Security leakage reduction (continued from Phase 0)
- **Risk E**: Logging standardization completion (started in Phase 0)

## üö® EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### **Agent Migration Rollback Procedures**

**Individual Agent Rollback (< 3 minutes):**
```bash
# Immediate rollback for single agent
AGENT_NAME="problematic_agent"
cp ${AGENT_NAME}.pre_migration_backup ${AGENT_NAME}.py
supervisorctl restart $AGENT_NAME
curl -f http://localhost:$PORT/health  # Verify recovery

# If restart fails:
systemctl restart agent_supervisor
# Escalate to on-call if still failing
```

**Batch Rollback (< 5 minutes):**
```bash
# Rollback entire batch of agents
BATCH_ID="week2_batch3"
for agent in $(cat migration_batches/$BATCH_ID.txt); do
    cp ${agent}.pre_migration_backup ${agent}.py
done
supervisorctl restart all
python scripts/validate_all_agents_healthy.py
```

**System-Wide Rollback (< 10 minutes):**
```bash
# Nuclear option - complete Phase 1 rollback
git revert --mainline 1 $PHASE_1_MERGE_COMMIT
git push --force-with-lease origin main
supervisorctl restart all
python scripts/emergency_health_check.py --all-agents
```

### **Health Monitoring During Migration**

**Real-Time Health Checks:**
```bash
# Continuous monitoring during migrations
while true; do
    python scripts/migration_health_monitor.py
    sleep 10
done

# Automated rollback triggers:
# - Agent down > 2 minutes
# - Response time > 200% baseline
# - Error rate > 5%
# - Memory usage > 150% baseline
```

**Cross-Machine Coordination:**
```bash
# Ensure MainPC-PC2 coordination during migrations
python scripts/cross_machine_health_sync.py --monitor-mode

# Coordination rules:
# - Never migrate ObservabilityHub on both machines simultaneously
# - Stagger critical service migrations by 4 hours minimum
# - Maintain at least one healthy hub at all times
```

### **Escalation Procedures**

**Migration Failure Escalation:**
1. **Immediate** (0-3 min): Automated rollback attempt
2. **Short-term** (3-10 min): Manual intervention and escalation to Lead SRE
3. **Extended** (10+ min): Incident commander activation, vendor support

**Communication Channels:**
- **Slack #ops-alerts**: Real-time migration status
- **PagerDuty**: Critical failures requiring immediate attention
- **Email**: Post-migration summaries and success reports
