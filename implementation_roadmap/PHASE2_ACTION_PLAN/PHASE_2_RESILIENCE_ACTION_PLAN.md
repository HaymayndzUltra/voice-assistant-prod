# 🎯 PHASE 2 ACTION PLAN: RESILIENCE & MONITORING

## 📅 TIMELINE: Weeks 4-8 → **UPDATED TO WEEKS 1-4**

## 🎯 FOCUS: DUAL-HUB INFRASTRUCTURE & SYSTEM RESILIENCE

### **SCOPE**
Deploy dual-hub ObservabilityHub architecture, implement NATS JetStream cross-machine coordination, and enhance system resilience patterns for production-grade operations.

### **RISKS ADDRESSED**

- B: Dependency graph edge-cases (PC2 deps causing socket hangs)
- H: Security leakage (credentials visible in process lists)
- E: File-based logging race (disk quota risks)
