## REFACTORING CAMPAIGN: Health Check Implementation (Phase 2 - Batch 3)

### SUMMARY REPORT

#### COMPLETED BATCH 3 REFACTORING

All 6 target files have been successfully modified to include the standardized `_get_health_status` method as required by Compliance Criterion C4. This completes the implementation of health check methods across all agent files.

#### MODIFIED FILES:

1. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/executor.py`
2. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/wake_word_detector.py`
3. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/streaming_speech_recognition.py`
4. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/language_and_translation_coordinator.py`
5. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/src/vision/vision_capture_agent.py`
6. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/face_recognition_agent.py`

#### IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

The following standardized `_get_health_status` method was added to each agent class:

```python
def _get_health_status(self):
    # Default health status: Agent is running if its main loop is active.
    # This can be expanded with more specific checks later.
    status = "HEALTHY" if self.running else "UNHEALTHY"
    details = {
        "status_message": "Agent is operational.",
        "uptime_seconds": time.time() - self.start_time if hasattr(self, 'start_time') else 0
    }
    return {"status": status, "details": details}
```

#### EXAMPLE DIFF (executor.py):

```diff
+    def _get_health_status(self):
+        # Default health status: Agent is running if its main loop is active.
+        # This can be expanded with more specific checks later.
+        status = "HEALTHY" if self.running else "UNHEALTHY"
+        details = {
+            "status_message": "Agent is operational.",
+            "uptime_seconds": time.time() - self.start_time if hasattr(self, 'start_time') else 0
+        }
+        return {"status": status, "details": details}
```

#### IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

1. All 6 files were successfully modified to include the standardized `_get_health_status` method.
2. None of the files had an existing implementation of the method, so no updates were required.
3. The `time` module was added to the imports for each file as needed.
4. The implementation assumes the existence of a `self.running` flag and optionally a `self.start_time` attribute in each agent class.

#### VERIFICATION:

All 6 files were verified to contain the `_get_health_status` method using a custom verification script. The verification was successful with 6/6 files passing the check.

#### PHASE 2 COMPLETION:

With the completion of Batch 3, all agent files now have the standardized `_get_health_status` method implemented, satisfying Compliance Criterion C4. The health check implementation phase (Phase 2) is now complete.

#### NEXT STEPS:

Proceed to the next phase of the refactoring campaign as outlined in the master plan.
