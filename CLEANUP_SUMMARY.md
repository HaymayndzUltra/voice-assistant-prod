# Codebase Cleanup Summary

**Date**: July 19, 2025  
**Backup Location**: `/workspace/backup_cleanup_20250719`

## Overview

A comprehensive cleanup of the codebase was performed to remove unused files, scripts, configurations, and agents. All removed items were backed up before deletion.

## Cleanup Statistics

### Phase 1
- **Files Deleted**: 58
- **Directories Deleted**: 6
- **Files Moved**: 21
- **Total Backed Up**: 64

### Phase 2
- **Files Deleted**: 91
- **Files Moved**: 10
- **Total Backed Up**: 91

### Total Impact
- **Total Files Removed**: 149
- **Total Directories Removed**: 6
- **Total Files Reorganized**: 31
- **Total Items Backed Up**: 155

## Major Changes

### 1. Archive Directories Removed
- `main_pc_code/agents/_archive`
- `main_pc_code/agents/_trash_2025-06-13`
- `pc2_code/agents/archive`
- `pc2_code/agents/backups`
- Phase 1 implementation backup directories

### 2. Test Files Reorganized
- Moved 21 test files from root directory to `/workspace/tests/`
- Removed duplicate test scripts that existed in multiple locations
- Cleaned up one-time test scripts from scripts directory

### 3. Scripts Cleaned Up
- **Fix Scripts**: Removed 27 one-time fix scripts (indentation, syntax, health checks)
- **Migration Scripts**: Removed 9 completed migration scripts
- **Analysis Scripts**: Removed 8 one-time analysis scripts
- **Duplicate Launchers**: Removed 5 duplicate startup scripts

### 4. Documentation Consolidated
- Archived 10 WP completion reports to `documentation/wp_reports/`
- Removed 17 redundant audit and report files
- Removed old health check reports

### 5. Miscellaneous Cleanup
- Removed temporary files (`.hex`, `.backup`, etc.)
- Removed unused configuration backups
- Removed empty marker files
- Removed dependency listing files
- Removed old shell scripts

## Remaining Structure

The codebase now has:
- Clear separation between main code and tests
- No duplicate or archived directories
- Consolidated documentation
- Only active scripts and configurations
- Cleaner root directory

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Test Organization**: Continue placing all test files in the `/tests` directory
2. **Script Management**: Avoid creating one-time scripts in root; use a `tools/` directory
3. **Documentation**: Keep reports in appropriate subdirectories, not root
4. **Version Control**: Use git branches instead of `_backup` or `_old` directories
5. **Cleanup Routine**: Schedule regular cleanup reviews (quarterly)

## Backup Information

All removed files have been backed up to `/workspace/backup_cleanup_20250719` with preserved directory structure. The backup can be:
- Reviewed for any mistakenly removed files
- Deleted after verification (recommended after 30 days)
- Archived to external storage if needed

## Next Steps

1. Run tests to ensure no critical dependencies were broken
2. Update any documentation that referenced removed files
3. Commit changes with message: "Cleanup: Major codebase cleanup - removed unused files, reorganized tests, consolidated documentation"
4. Consider implementing pre-commit hooks to prevent accumulation of temporary files
