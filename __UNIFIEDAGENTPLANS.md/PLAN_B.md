Distributed AI System Architectural Refactoring Analysis
1. Analysis Summary
Based on the described system architecture with main_pc (RTX 4090 - "Engine") and pc2 (RTX 3060 - "Coordinator"), the system appears to have evolved organically over time, resulting in overlapping responsibilities and unclear boundaries between agents. The key architectural issues identified include:

Redundant Health Monitoring: Multiple agents performing similar health checks and monitoring functions
Overlapping State Management: Digital twin, memory orchestration, and context management handling similar concerns
Duplicated Vision Processing: Face recognition and general vision processing likely share common infrastructure
Unclear Request Routing: Request coordination and task scheduling have overlapping responsibilities
2. Current Agent Overlaps
| Agent Category | main_pc (Engine) | pc2 (Coordinator) | Overlap Areas | Recommended Action | |----------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------| | Health Monitoring | PredictiveHealthMonitor | HealthMonitor, SystemHealthManager | - System metrics collection<br>- Alert generation<br>- Health status reporting | Consolidate into single HealthMonitoringService | | State Management | SystemDigitalTwin | MemoryOrchestratorService, ContextManager | - State persistence<br>- Context tracking<br>- Memory coordination | Merge into unified StateManagementService | | Request Handling | RequestCoordinator | TaskScheduler, AdvancedRouter | - Request routing<br>- Task prioritization<br>- Load balancing | Create single RequestOrchestrator | | Vision Processing | FaceRecognitionAgent | VisionProcessingAgent | - Image preprocessing<br>- Feature extraction<br>- Model inference | Unified VisionService with modular capabilities |
