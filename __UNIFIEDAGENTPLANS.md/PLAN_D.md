Distributed AI System Architectural Refactoring Analysis
Analysis Summary
Based on the task requirements, this analysis will examine the agent configurations for:

main_pc (RTX 4090): High-performance compute node with 24GB VRAM
pc2 (RTX 3060): Mid-range compute node with 12GB VRAM
The goal is to identify consolidation opportunities while maintaining the "Engine" vs. "Coordinator" pattern and optimizing for hardware capabilities.

Current Agent Overlaps Analysis
Health Monitoring Overlap
| Agent | Location | Primary Function | Overlap Points | |-------|----------|------------------|----------------| | PredictiveHealthMonitor | main_pc | Predictive analytics, ML-based health forecasting | System monitoring, alerting | | HealthMonitor | pc2 | Real-time health checks, status reporting | Health data collection | | SystemHealthManager | pc2 | System resource monitoring, performance tracking | Health monitoring, resource management |
