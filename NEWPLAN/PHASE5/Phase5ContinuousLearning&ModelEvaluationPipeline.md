2. Logic & Implementation Comparison
   Learning Opportunity Detection
   Active Learning Monitor: Uses keyword-based heuristics to identify valuable interactions
   Tutor Agent: Uses performance metrics to identify learning needs
   No centralized approach: Each agent implements its own detection logic
   Training Management
   Learning Manager: Focuses on managing learning sessions and parameters
   Self-Training Orchestrator: Focuses on resource allocation and cycle management
   Overlap: Both maintain their own databases and track progress independently
   Performance Evaluation
   Agent Trust Scorer: Calculates trust scores based on success rate and response time
   Performance Logger Agent: Logs raw performance metrics without evaluation
   Tutor Agent: Evaluates performance in the context of learning progress
   Inconsistent metrics: Each agent uses different evaluation criteria
   Data Storage
   Multiple independent databases: Each agent maintains its own database
   No shared schema: Inconsistent data structures across agents
   Limited data sharing: Minimal cross-agent data utilization
3. Conflict & Redundancy Identification
   Redundant Training Management
   Both Learning Manager and Self-Training Orchestrator manage training cycles
   Overlapping responsibilities in tracking progress and maintaining history
   Separate databases with similar schemas but no synchronization
   Fragmented Performance Tracking
   Agent Trust Scorer and Performance Logger Agent both track performance metrics
   Duplicated storage of performance data across multiple databases
   No centralized performance evaluation framework
   Disconnected Learning Pipelines
   Active Learning Monitor and Tutor Agent both identify learning opportunities
   No shared mechanism for prioritizing learning needs
   Separate learning strategies with no coordination
   Inconsistent Data Models
   Each agent defines its own data structures for similar concepts
   No standardized schema for training cycles, performance metrics, or learning sessions
   Limited data interoperability between agents
   Cross-Machine Communication Inefficiencies
   Agents on different machines (Main PC vs PC2) have limited integration
   No clear delegation of responsibilities between machines
   Redundant implementations across machines

   Conclusion
   The current learning and model evaluation architecture shows significant fragmentation and redundancy. By consolidating the six agents into three primary components with clear responsibilities and standardized interfaces, we can create a more cohesive, efficient, and scalable continuous learning framework.
   The proposed architecture addresses the identified issues by:
   Eliminating redundant implementations
   Standardizing data models and communication protocols
   Clarifying responsibilities between Main PC and PC2
   Providing a clear learning pipeline from opportunity detection to model evaluation
   Enabling more efficient resource utilization across the system
   This refactoring will result in a more maintainable, scalable, and effective continuous learning system that can better adapt to changing requirements and improve model performance over time.
