## Phase 2A: Create MemoryOrchestratorService

**Summary:**
A new MemoryOrchestratorService was created on PC2 as the central pillar of the distributed memory system. This service consolidates the ZMQ API logic from the main PC's MemoryOrchestrator, robust SQLite persistence from PC2's MemoryManager, and in-memory LRU caching inspired by CacheManager. It exposes a unified ZMQ REP API for add_memory, get_memory, search_memory, update_memory, and delete_memory, using Pydantic models for validation. The service is now the single source of truth for all memory operations, providing high performance and reliability. Startup configuration and manifests have been updated to reflect this new core service.

**Note:** The service file was moved to `pc2_code/agents/memory_orchestrator_service.py` to maintain architectural consistency. All configuration and documentation now reference this location.

# Refactor: Centralized 'common' Module

**Summary:**
A major refactor was performed to centralize all code shared between main_pc_code and pc2_code. A new top-level 'common' directory was created, with 'core' and 'utils' subdirectories. The foundational BaseAgent class was moved to common/core/base_agent.py, and the shared data_models.py was moved to common/utils/data_models.py. All import statements across the entire monorepo were updated to reference these new shared locations, ensuring a clean, maintainable, and containerization-friendly architecture. The old src/core and src/common directories were removed if empty.

# Migration: All Agents to main_pc_code/agents/

**Summary:**
All remaining agent scripts were migrated from the legacy main_pc_code/src directory to the centralized main_pc_code/agents/ directory. The main_pc_code/config/startup_config.yaml and NEWPLAN/ALLINFOMAINAGENTS2_ORDERED.MD were updated to reflect the new script paths for PredictiveHealthMonitor, MemoryOrchestrator, MemoryClient, and FusedAudioPreprocessor.

Phase 4, Task 4.1: COMPLETED
Created foundational TranslationService agent by merging logic from ConsolidatedTranslator and LanguageAndTranslationCoordinator. Implemented modular structure with placeholders for LanguageDetector, TranslationCache, SessionManager, and EngineManager. Phase 0-compliant, with placeholder translation pipeline and logging. No real engine calls yet; structure ready for further logic migration and integration.

Phase 4, Task 4.2: COMPLETED
Integrated NLLB, Streaming, and Remote engines into TranslationService using a standardized BaseEngineClient interface. Implemented NLLBEngineClient, StreamingEngineClient, and RemoteGoogleEngineClient, each handling ZMQ communication and payloads for their respective agents. EngineManager now orchestrates translation requests with a robust fallback chain. All engine calls are routed through the new interface, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

Phase 4, Task 4.3: COMPLETED
Refactored consumer agents (e.g., ChitchatAgent) to use the new TranslationService. Updated startup_config.yaml to register TranslationService and mark legacy translation agents (ConsolidatedTranslator, LanguageAndTranslationCoordinator) as deprecated. Updated ALLINFOMAINAGENTS2_ORDERED.MD to reflect new architecture and dependencies. System now routes all translation requests through the central service.

Phase 4: Distributed Translation Service Optimization - COMPLETED. Consolidated legacy translation agents (`ConsolidatedTranslator`, `LanguageAndTranslationCoordinator`) into a single, modular `TranslationService`. All consumer agents have been migrated to the new service. Legacy agent entries have been removed from all active configurations and manifests. The system is now functionally migrated and ready for final verification before the legacy files are permanently deleted.

Phase 4.5, Task A: IN PROGRESS. Migrated core logic to `TranslationService`. Replicated the multi-tier language detection pipeline (langdetect, fasttext, TagaBERTa, lexicon) from `LanguageAndTranslationCoordinator`. Implemented the fast, local Dictionary Engine from `ConsolidatedTranslator` and placed it as the first step in the fallback chain. The TranslationService now has feature parity with the legacy translation agents, with a more modular and maintainable architecture.

Phase 4.5, Task B: COMPLETED. Hardened `TranslationService` for production. Implemented full CurveZMQ security for both server and client sockets, socket reuse for all engine clients to improve performance, fixed session memory leak with a robust pruning mechanism, and optimized cache keys using SHA-256 hashing. These improvements enhance security, performance, and memory management for the translation service.

Phase 4.5, Task C: COMPLETED. Implemented a centralized `ConnectionManager` within `TranslationService`. All sub-modules (`EngineClient`, `LanguageDetector`, `TranslationCache`, `SessionManager`) now request shared sockets from this manager instead of creating their own, improving resource efficiency and maintainability. This eliminates socket resource leaks, streamlines connection error handling, and provides a single point of control for all ZMQ connections.

Phase 4.5 - Hardening (Final): COMPLETED. Fixed critical cross-machine I/O bottleneck in `TranslationService`. Implemented a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to handle all write operations to `MemoryOrchestratorService` (PC2) asynchronously. Protected all read operations from PC2 with a `CircuitBreaker` pattern to prevent the service from freezing when the remote service is unresponsive. The service is now fully non-blocking and resilient to PC2 connectivity issues, with proper graceful shutdown ensuring all pending writes complete before exit. These changes dramatically improve the service's stability, performance, and fault tolerance in production environments.

## Phase 5: Continuous Learning & Model Evaluation Pipeline - COMPLETED

### Task 1: Learning Pipeline Data Models - COMPLETED

**Summary:** Created a new shared library `common/utils/learning_models.py` to standardize data structures for the continuous learning pipeline. Defined Pydantic models for `LearningOpportunity`, `TrainingCycle`, `PerformanceMetric`, and `ModelEvaluationScore`. These models provide a standardized foundation for all learning and evaluation agents on both Main PC and PC2, ensuring consistent data exchange and validation throughout the learning pipeline.

## Phase 5.2, Task 2: Learning Opportunity Detector - COMPLETED

**Summary:** Created the new `LearningOpportunityDetector` (LOD) agent on Main PC. Migrated the core interaction monitoring logic from `ActiveLearningMonitor` and the performance-based learning detection logic from `TutorAgent`. All detected opportunities are now standardized using the `LearningOpportunity` Pydantic model. The agent monitors interactions from multiple sources, analyzes them for learning value, and creates properly scored and prioritized learning opportunities.

## Phase 5.2, Task 3: Learning Orchestration Service - COMPLETED

**Summary:** Created the new `LearningOrchestrationService` (LOS) agent on Main PC. Merged the session/parameter management logic from `LearningManager` and the resource allocation/cycle management logic from `SelfTrainingOrchestrator`. The LOS can now fetch opportunities from the LOD and create standardized `TrainingCycle` objects. Implemented the core workflow including opportunity fetching, training cycle creation, resource allocation, and training job initiation. The service maintains a unified SQLite database for storing learning opportunities and training cycles.

## Phase 5.2, Task 4: Model Evaluation Framework - COMPLETED

**Summary:** Created the new `ModelEvaluationFramework` (MEF) agent on PC2. Merged the data collection logic from `PerformanceLoggerAgent` and the scoring logic from `AgentTrustScorer`. The MEF now serves as the central hub for all performance tracking and model evaluation, using the standardized Pydantic models. Implemented a SUB socket to passively listen for performance metrics, a unified database for storing both raw metrics and evaluation scores, and a periodic evaluation system that generates `ModelEvaluationScore` objects based on collected metrics.
