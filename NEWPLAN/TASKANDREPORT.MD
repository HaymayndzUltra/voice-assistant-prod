# System Refactoring Tasks and Reports

## Phase 0: Foundation & Standardization - COMPLETED

### Summary

### Task 2: GoalManager Implementation - COMPLETED

#### Summary
Successfully hardened and fully integrated the GoalManager agent, which consolidates the functionality of the former GoalOrchestratorAgent and MultiAgentSwarmManager. The GoalManager now serves as the central authority for decomposing high-level goals, managing task dependencies, and coordinating swarms of specialized agents. The implementation follows Phase 0 standards and incorporates critical software patterns for improved resilience and performance.

#### Key Changes Implemented

It now serves as the system's primary reasoning and model execution engine, handling all complex planning, multi-step reasoning, model selection, and execution logic. The agent features robust context management, dynamic model selection, and resilient execution patterns using circuit breakers.

#### Key Changes Implemented

- **System Integration**:
  - Removed legacy EnhancedModelRouter and UnifiedPlanningAgent files
  - Updated startup_config.yaml to enable ModelOrchestrator and remove old agents
  - Updated agent manifests to reflect the new architecture

#### Benefits

- **Unified Reasoning Engine**: All complex planning and model execution is now handled by a single, robust agent
- **Resilience**: Circuit breaker pattern ensures robust handling of external service failures
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Automatically routes tasks to the most appropriate model
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains and leverages conversation and task context for better results
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Reduces code duplication and clarifies responsibility boundaries

### Task 4: ModelOrchestrator Hardening - COMPLETED

#### Summary
A critical hardening pass was performed on the ModelOrchestrator agent to ensure full Phase 0 compliance, robust integration, and long-term maintainability. The following four key improvements were implemented:

1. **Standardized Communication with a Helper Method**: Introduced a private `_send_request` method to encapsulate all ZMQ request logic, including circuit breaker checks, error handling, and logging. All external service calls now use this standardized helper.
2. **Dynamic Model Routing**: Upgraded the model selection logic to dynamically request model recommendations from ModelManagerAgent, removing all hardcoded routing.
3. **Standardized Output for GoalManager Compliance**: Refactored the planning and execution logic to return a list of `TaskDefinition` dictionaries, fully matching the Pydantic model structure and ensuring seamless integration with GoalManager.
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Centralized error handling in the new helper method and improved logging throughout the agent for maximum robustness and traceability.

With these changes, the ModelOrchestrator is now fully robust, compliant, and ready for long-term production use. **Phase 1: Core Orchestration Consolidation is now truly complete and robust.**
