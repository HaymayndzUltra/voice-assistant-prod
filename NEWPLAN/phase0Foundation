## Phase 0: Foundation & Standardization - COMPLETED

### Summary
Phase 0 established standardized protocols for data handling, communication, and service discovery across the entire distributed system. This foundational work ensures all subsequent development is built upon a robust, consistent, and maintainable foundation.

### Key Changes Implemented

- **Created standardized data models** in `common/utils/data_models.py`:
  - Implemented Pydantic models for critical cross-system data structures
  - Created models for TaskDefinition, TaskResult, SystemEvent, ErrorReport, PerformanceMetric, and AgentRegistration
  - Provided comprehensive type definitions, validation, and example data

- **Enhanced BaseAgent class** in `common/core/base_agent.py`:
  - Added standardized ZMQ communication methods with proper error handling
  - Integrated Pydantic data models for type validation
  - Implemented auto-registration with SystemDigitalTwin
  - Added robust error reporting and event publishing capabilities

- **Refactored SystemDigitalTwin agent** in `main_pc_code/agents/system_digital_twin.py`:
  - Added comprehensive agent registration and discovery functionality
  - Implemented event distribution system
  - Added error reporting and tracking capabilities
  - Enhanced type safety and error handling

- **Updated startup configurations** in `main_pc_code/config/startup_config.yaml`:
  - Ensured SystemDigitalTwin is launched first with highest priority
  - Added explicit dependencies on SystemDigitalTwin for all agents
  - Added startup priority values to ensure proper initialization sequence
  - Removed hardcoded endpoints in favor of service discovery

### Recent Updates (July 6, 2025)

- **Completed Phase 1: Core Orchestration Consolidation**
  - Successfully merged six legacy agents into three new agents (RequestCoordinator, GoalManager, ModelOrchestrator)
  - Updated configuration files to reflect the new architecture
  - Fixed dependency issues in startup_config.yaml

- **Completed Phase 2: Distributed Memory System Refactoring**
  - Implemented MemoryOrchestratorService as the central memory management system on PC2
  - Removed legacy memory agents (including EpisodicMemoryAgent)
  - Simplified SQLite schema and integrated Redis for caching
  - Created MemoryClient for Main PC agents to interact with the central memory service

- **Started Phase 3: Distributed Error Management & Self-Healing**
  - Modified RCA_Agent to send error reports to UnifiedErrorAgent instead of SelfHealingAgent
  - Standardized error reporting format across the system
  - Implementing centralized error collection and management

### Benefits

- **Standardized Communication**: All agents now use consistent data formats and communication patterns
- **Service Discovery**: Agents can dynamically discover each other without hardcoded endpoints
- **Improved Error Handling**: Standardized error reporting and handling across the system
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type checking and validation for all cross-agent communication
- **Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication and improved consistency
- **Centralized Memory Management**: Single source of truth for all memory operations
- **Unified Error Management**: Consolidated error reporting and analysis
