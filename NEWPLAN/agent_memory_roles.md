   Key Responsibilities:
   On-demand loading and unloading of NLLB model
   Handles translation requests for the NLLB model
   Manages resource usage for the model
   Provides health monitoring for the NLLB service
   Optimizes performance with dynamic quantization

   Key Responsibilities:
   Processes casual conversation requests
   Connects to local or remote LLM for responses
   Maintains conversation history
   Manages user sessions
   Provides fallback mechanisms for LLM failures
2. Logic & Implementation Comparison
   Translation Execution Logic
   Consolidated Translator: Implements a sophisticated pipeline with multiple engines and fallbacks
   Fixed Streaming Translation: Focuses on real-time streaming with adaptive timeouts
   Language and Translation Coordinator: Emphasizes language detection before translation
   NLLB Adapter: Provides direct model access with resource management
   Remote Connector: Acts as a proxy to external services
   Chitchat Agent: Uses translation services for conversational purposes
   Fallback Strategies
   Consolidated Translator: Multi-tier fallback system (dictionary → NLLB → fixed streaming → Google)
   Fixed Streaming Translation: PC2 translation → Google → local patterns → emergency fallback
   Language and Translation Coordinator: Similar multi-tier fallback with additional language detection
   Remote Connector: Provides fallback between different API providers
   Caching Mechanisms
   Consolidated Translator: Advanced caching with TTL and eviction policies
   Fixed Streaming Translation: Simple cache with TTL
   Language and Translation Coordinator: Similar caching system
   Remote Connector: File-based caching with TTL
   Cross-Machine Communication
   All agents use ZMQ for inter-process and cross-machine communication
   Consolidated Translator and Language and Translation Coordinator communicate with PC2
   Remote Connector on PC2 communicates back to Main PC services
3. Conflict & Redundancy Identification
   Overlapping Responsibilities
   Translation Logic Duplication:
   Both Consolidated Translator and Language and Translation Coordinator implement similar translation pipelines
   Both have their own caching systems, session management, and fallback strategies
   Redundant Fallback Mechanisms:
   Multiple agents implement Google Translate fallback independently
   Similar error handling and recovery logic exists across agents
   Duplicate Language Detection:
   Language detection exists in both Consolidated Translator and Language and Translation Coordinator
   Similar Tagalog word sets and detection heuristics are duplicated
   Health Monitoring Redundancy:
   Each agent implements its own health monitoring system
   Similar metrics are tracked independently
   Cache Implementation Duplication:
   Multiple independent cache implementations across agents
   No shared cache invalidation strategy
   Cross-PC Communication Inconsistency:
   Inconsistent approach to service discovery and connection management
   Hard-coded IP addresses in some places vs. config-driven in others
4. Architectural Recommendations
   A. Simplification & Merging Strategy
   Unified Translation Service Architecture:
   Merge Consolidated Translator and Language and Translation Coordinator into a single Translation Service
   Create a clear separation of concerns:
   Language Detection Module
   Translation Engine Manager
   Caching Service
   Session Management Service
   Health Monitoring Service
   Standardized Engine Interface:
   Define a common interface for all translation engines
   Implement engines as plugins to the Translation Service
   Standardize request/response formats across all engines
   Centralized Caching System:
   Implement a single, shared caching service used by all translation components
   Use Memory Orchestrator for persistent cache storage
   Implement distributed cache invalidation
   Unified Health Monitoring:
   Create a centralized health monitoring system
   Standardize health metrics across all translation components
   Implement automatic recovery strategies based on health status
   B. Clarification of Roles & Protocols
   Translation Service Hierarchy:
   Primary Translation Gateway (Main PC): Single entry point for all translation requests
   Handles language detection, routing, and fallback management
   Maintains session state and history
   Provides unified API for all translation needs
   Translation Engine Manager (Main PC): Manages translation engines
   Loads/unloads models as needed
   Monitors engine health and performance
   Implements intelligent engine selection
   Remote Translation Provider (PC2): Provides specialized translation services
   Handles resource-intensive models
   Implements external API access (Google Translate)
   Provides fallback capabilities
   Standardized Communication Protocol:
   Define a consistent ZMQ message format for all translation services
   Implement proper error handling and timeout management
   Use service discovery for dynamic endpoint resolution
   Clear Fallback Chain:
   Define a clear, configurable fallback chain for translation
   Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   Log and monitor fallback usage for optimization
