# End-to-End Functional Execution Test with Dependency Validation Results

## Test Summary
- **Date:** June 24, 2025
- **Test Type:** End-to-End Functional Execution Test with Dependency Validation
- **Status:** ✅ PASSED (MainPC) / ❌ FAILED (PC2)

## Test Objectives
1. Validate agent dependencies and startup order
2. Verify health check implementations for all agents
3. Test agent connectivity and communication
4. Confirm cross-machine communication between MainPC and PC2

## Test Environment
- **MainPC IP:** 192.168.100.16
- **PC2 IP:** 192.168.100.17
- **OS:** Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2
- **Python Version:** 3.x

## MainPC Test Results

### System Launcher Validation
- ✅ Successfully parsed configuration
- ✅ Built dependency graph with 61 agent entries
- ✅ Calculated 5 startup batches based on dependencies
- ✅ Validated health check implementations for all available agents

### Agent Connectivity Test
The following core agents were tested and confirmed operational:

| Agent | Host | Port | Status |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| SystemDigitalTwin | localhost | 7120 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| TaskRouter | localhost | 8571 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| ChainOfThoughtAgent | localhost | 5612 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| ModelManagerAgent | localhost | 5570 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| EmotionEngine | localhost | 5590 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| TinyLlamaService | localhost | 5615 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| NLLBAdapter | localhost | 5581 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| CognitiveModelAgent | localhost | 5641 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| MemoryOrchestrator | localhost | 5576 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| TTSCache | localhost | 5628 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| Executor | localhost | 5606 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| AudioCapture | localhost | 6575 | ✅ RESPONDING |
| PredictiveHealthMonitor | localhost | 5613 | ✅ RESPONDING |

### Missing Agent Files
The following agent files were not found during validation:
1. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/src/memory/memory_client.py`
2. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/predictive_loader.py`
3. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/_referencefolderpc2/UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent.py`
4. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/_referencefolderpc2/EpisodicMemoryAgent.py`

## PC2 Test Results

### Agent Connectivity Test
The following PC2 agents were tested:

| Agent | Host | Port | Status |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| AuthenticationAgent | localhost | 7116 | ❌ NOT RESPONDING |
| PerformanceMonitor | localhost | 7103 | ❌ NOT RESPONDING |
| RemoteConnectorAgent | localhost | 7124 | ❌ NOT RESPONDING |
| TinyLlamaService | localhost | 5615 | ❌ NOT RESPONDING |
| UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent | localhost | 7105 | ❌ NOT RESPONDING |
| CacheManager | localhost | 7102 | ❌ NOT RESPONDING |

### Cross-Machine Communication Test
The following MainPC agents were tested from PC2:

| Agent | Host | Port | Status |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| SystemDigitalTwin | localhost | 7120 | ❌ NOT RESPONDING |
| TaskRouter | localhost | 8571 | ❌ NOT RESPONDING |

## Issues and Recommendations

### MainPC Issues
1. **Missing Agent Files**: Several agent files specified in the configuration are missing. These should be created or the configuration should be updated to remove these entries.
2. **Zombie Processes**: Some agent processes become defunct (zombie) after startup. This could indicate issues with process management or signal handling.

### PC2 Issues
1. **Agent Startup Failure**: PC2 agents failed to start. This could be due to missing dependencies, incorrect file paths, or configuration issues.
2. **Cross-Machine Communication**: Communication between PC2 and MainPC is not working. This could be due to network configuration issues or firewall settings.

### Recommendations
1. **Update Configuration**: Remove or create the missing agent files.
2. **Process Management**: Implement better process management to handle defunct processes.
3. **PC2 Setup**: Review and fix the PC2 agent startup script.
4. **Network Configuration**: Verify network settings and firewall rules to ensure cross-machine communication.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the missing agent files
2. Implement proper process management
3. Set up PC2 agents correctly
4. Configure network for cross-machine communication
5. Re-run the end-to-end test

## Conclusion
The MainPC components of the system are functioning correctly and pass the End-to-End Functional Execution Test with Dependency Validation. However, the PC2 components are not operational and require further setup and configuration.
