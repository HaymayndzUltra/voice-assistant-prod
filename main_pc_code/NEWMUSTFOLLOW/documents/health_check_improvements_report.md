# MVS Health Check Improvements Report

## Overview

This report details the improvements made to the Minimal Viable System (MVS) health checker script (`check_mvs_health.py`). The improvements were based on the successful implementation in `mainpc_health_checker_subset.py`, which demonstrated the ability to correctly verify the health of the four core agents.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Custom Health Check Configurations

Added support for agent-specific health check configurations:

```python
custom_health_checks = {
    "CoordinatorAgent": {
        "health_check_port": 26010,  # Override default port+1 pattern
        "success_key": "status",
        "success_value": "healthy",   # Expects "healthy" instead of "ok"
        "type": "zmq_req"
    },
    "SystemDigitalTwin": {
        # Uses default health_check_port (port+1)
        "success_key": "status",
        "success_value": "ok",
        "type": "zmq_req"
    }
}
```

This allows each agent to have its own:

- Custom health check port (especially important for CoordinatorAgent which uses port 26010)
- Custom success criteria (some agents return "healthy" while others return "ok")
- Custom health check method (ZMQ or HTTP)

### 2. Increased Timeout

Increased the ZMQ timeout from 500ms to 10000ms (10 seconds) to match the successful implementation:

```python
# ZMQ timeout (milliseconds) - increased from 500ms to match successful implementation
TIMEOUT = 10000  # 10 seconds - same as in mainpc_health_checker_subset.py
```

This gives agents more time to respond, which is especially important for agents that might be performing resource-intensive operations.

### 3. Enhanced ZMQ Communication

Improved ZMQ socket configuration:

- Set `LINGER` to 0 to prevent blocking on close
- Set both `RCVTIMEO` and `SNDTIMEO` for better timeout handling
- Used 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost for more reliable connections
- Added proper socket polling with timeout

### 4. HTTP Health Check Support

Added support for HTTP-based health checks, which is used by some agents like SystemDigitalTwin:

```python
def _check_http_health(name: str, health_check_config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # HTTP health check implementation
    # ...
```

This allows checking agents that expose health information via HTTP endpoints rather than ZMQ.

### 5. Improved Response Validation

Enhanced response validation to handle different response formats:

- Case-insensitive string comparison for status values
- Support for different success keys and values
- Proper type checking and error handling

```python
# Handle string comparison case
if isinstance(response_value, str) and isinstance(success_value, str):
    is_healthy = response_value.lower() == success_value.lower()
# Direct equality comparison for non-string types
else:
    is_healthy = response_value == success_value
```

### 6. Better Error Handling and Reporting

Improved error handling throughout the script:

- Detailed error messages
- Proper exception handling
- Visual indicators in the terminal output (color coding, emoji markers)
- JSON report export for later analysis

## Testing Results

The improved health checker is now able to correctly verify the health of all agents in the MVS, including:

- CoordinatorAgent (using custom port 26010 and expecting "healthy" status)
- SystemDigitalTwin (supporting both ZMQ and HTTP health checks)
- MemoryOrchestrator
- ModelManagerAgent

## Conclusion

The MVS health checker has been successfully upgraded with the intelligent health check logic from the successful `mainpc_health_checker_subset.py` script. It now has the ability to handle different health check mechanisms and response formats, making it more robust and reliable for verifying the health of the Minimal Viable System.
