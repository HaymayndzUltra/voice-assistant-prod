# Config-Driven Refactoring Report

## Overview

This report documents the comprehensive refactoring performed on the Minimal Viable System (MVS) to eliminate hardcoded configuration values and implement a fully config-driven architecture. This change establishes a single source of truth for all agent configurations, improving maintainability, reducing errors, and enabling easier system configuration.

## Key Changes

### 1. Single Source of Truth

Created a comprehensive configuration file (`minimal_system_config_local.yaml`) that serves as the single source of truth for all agent configurations. This file contains:

- Global settings applicable to all agents
- Core agent configurations with all necessary parameters
- Dependency agent configurations
- Port assignments, health check ports, and dependencies

### 2. Agent Refactoring

Refactored agent scripts to remove hardcoded values and make them fully config-driven:

- **CoordinatorAgent**: Removed hardcoded ports (26002, 26010), timeouts, and other settings
- **ModelManagerAgent**: Removed hardcoded ports (5570, 5571), VRAM settings, and other configurations
- **Other Agents**: Similar refactoring applied to all MVS agents

### 3. Launcher Improvements

Created a new agent launching system that:

- Dynamically loads agent modules based on configuration
- Passes the correct configuration block to each agent's constructor
- Handles dependencies correctly, launching agents in the proper order
- Provides better error handling and reporting

### 4. Agent Constructor Changes

Modified agent constructors to:

- Accept a configuration dictionary
- Extract all needed parameters from the configuration
- Use sensible defaults for missing parameters
- Pass required parameters to the parent class constructor

## Implementation Details

### Configuration File Structure

The `minimal_system_config_local.yaml` file is structured as follows:

```yaml
# Global settings
global:
  bind_address: '0.0.0.0'
  secure_zmq: false
  zmq_request_timeout: 10000
  # ...

# Core agents
core_agents:
  - name: 'SystemDigitalTwin'
    file_path: 'system_digital_twin.py'
    port: 7120
    health_check_port: 7121
    # Agent-specific configuration...
    dependencies: []

  # Other core agents...

# Dependencies
dependencies:
  - name: 'TaskRouter'
    # Agent-specific configuration...
    dependencies: ['SystemDigitalTwin', 'CoordinatorAgent']

  # Other dependencies...
```

### Agent Constructor Pattern

All agents now follow this constructor pattern:

```python
def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    # Store configuration
    self.config = kwargs

    # Get basic parameters with defaults
    port = self.config.get('port', 5000)
    name = self.config.get('name', 'DefaultName')
    health_check_port = self.config.get('health_check_port', port + 1)

    # Initialize base agent
    super().__init__(name=name, port=port, health_check_port=health_check_port)

    # Get agent-specific configuration
    self.some_setting = self.config.get('some_setting', 'default_value')
    # ...
```

### Launcher Implementation

The new `start_mvs.py` launcher:

1. Loads the configuration from `minimal_system_config_local.yaml`
2. Dynamically imports agent modules based on file paths
3. Finds the appropriate agent class in each module
4. Instantiates agents with their specific configuration blocks
5. Launches agents in dependency order using threads
6. Monitors agent health and reports issues

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Configuration Errors**: Eliminates inconsistencies between hardcoded values and configuration files
2. **Easier Maintenance**: All configuration is in one place, making changes simpler and safer
3. **Better Dependency Management**: Clear specification of agent dependencies ensures proper startup order
4. **Improved Portability**: System can be deployed in different environments by changing only the configuration file
5. **Enhanced Debugging**: Configuration-related issues are easier to identify and fix

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the refactored system to ensure all agents start correctly
2. **Documentation**: Update system documentation to reflect the new config-driven approach
3. **Expansion**: Apply the same pattern to additional agents as they are added to the MVS
4. **Validation**: Implement configuration validation to catch errors before agent startup

## Conclusion

This refactoring represents a significant improvement to the MVS architecture. By eliminating hardcoded configuration values and implementing a fully config-driven approach, we have created a more maintainable, flexible, and robust system. The single source of truth for configuration will prevent many common errors and make future development more efficient.
