# MVS Project Continuation Guide

## Current Project Status

We have created a Minimal Viable System (MVS) that focuses on the 9 healthy agents and their direct dependencies. This approach allows us to establish a stable core system before expanding to include more agents.

### Completed Tasks:

1. ✅ Created `minimal_system_config.yaml` with the 9 healthy agents and their direct dependencies
2. ✅ Identified environment variables required by the MVS agents
3. ✅ Created `run_mvs.sh` script to set up the environment and launch the MVS
4. ✅ Created `check_mvs_health.py` to verify agent health status
5. ✅ Created `start_mvs.py` with improved error handling and logging
6. ✅ Created troubleshooting guide in `mvs_troubleshooting.md`
7. ✅ Fixed SelfTrainingOrchestrator bug (is_running vs running)

### Current Files in NEWMUSTFOLLOW:

- `minimal_system_config.yaml`: Configuration for the MVS agents
- `run_mvs.sh`: Shell script to set up environment and run the MVS
- `check_mvs_health.py`: Script to check the health of MVS agents
- `start_mvs.py`: Improved Python script to start the MVS
- `mvs_summary.md`: Summary of the MVS components
- `mvs_troubleshooting.md`: Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- `PROJECT_CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md`: This guide for future sessions

## Next Steps

### 1. Installation and Setup

- [ ] Create installation instructions for required Python packages
- [ ] Document system requirements (CPU, RAM, GPU)
- [ ] Set up proper directory structure for models and data

### 2. Testing the MVS

- [ ] Test each agent individually to verify functionality
- [ ] Test the complete MVS to ensure all agents work together
- [ ] Document any issues encountered and their solutions

### 3. Stabilization

- [ ] Standardize health check responses across all agents
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for all agents
- [ ] Add logging to all agents for better debugging

### 4. Expansion

- [ ] Identify the next set of agents to add to the system
- [ ] Update configuration to include these agents
- [ ] Test expanded system for stability

### 5. Documentation

- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for the system
- [ ] Document agent interactions and dependencies
- [ ] Create diagrams of system architecture

## Running the MVS

To run the MVS:

1. Ensure all required Python packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install zmq pyyaml psutil
   ```

2. Set up the environment and launch the MVS:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/AI_System_Monorepo
   chmod +x main_pc_code/NEWMUSTFOLLOW/run_mvs.sh
   ./main_pc_code/NEWMUSTFOLLOW/run_mvs.sh
   ```

3. Alternatively, use the improved Python starter:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/AI_System_Monorepo
   python main_pc_code/NEWMUSTFOLLOW/start_mvs.py
   ```

4. Check the health of the MVS:
   ```bash
   python main_pc_code/NEWMUSTFOLLOW/check_mvs_health.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, refer to `mvs_troubleshooting.md` for common problems and their solutions.

## MVS Agents

The MVS consists of the following agents:

### Core Healthy Agents:
1. ModelManagerAgent
2. ChainOfThoughtAgent
3. GOT_TOTAgent
4. CoordinatorAgent
5. SystemDigitalTwin
6. TinyLlamaService
7. LearningAdjusterAgent
8. StreamingInterruptHandler
9. MemoryOrchestrator

### Direct Dependencies:
1. SelfTrainingOrchestrator
2. StreamingSpeechRecognition
3. FusedAudioPreprocessor
4. AudioCapture
5. TaskRouter
6. StreamingTTSAgent

For a detailed description of each agent, refer to `mvs_summary.md`.

## Environment Variables

The MVS requires several environment variables to function correctly. These are set in `run_mvs.sh` and include:

- Machine configuration (MACHINE_TYPE, PYTHONPATH)
- Network configuration (MAIN_PC_IP, PC2_IP, BIND_ADDRESS)
- Security settings (SECURE_ZMQ, ZMQ_CERTIFICATES_DIR)
- Service discovery settings
- Voice pipeline ports
- Resource constraints
- Logging settings
- Timeouts and retries
- Voice pipeline settings
- Agent-specific variables

## Known Issues

1. SelfTrainingOrchestrator has inconsistent attribute naming (`is_running` vs `running`)
2. Some agents may have health check format inconsistencies (returning "HEALTHY" vs "ok")
3. Environment variables may need adjustment based on the specific deployment environment

## Future Improvements

1. Containerize the MVS for easier deployment
2. Add monitoring and metrics collection
3. Implement automatic recovery for failed agents
4. Create a web-based dashboard for system status
5. Improve dependency management between agents
