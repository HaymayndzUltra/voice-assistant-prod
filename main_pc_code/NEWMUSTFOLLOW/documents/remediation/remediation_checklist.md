## Remaining Tasks
1. Fix remaining indentation issues in `system_digital_twin.py`
2. Fix remaining indentation issues in `service_discovery_client.py`
3. Fix missing exception handling in `network_utils.py`
4. Standardize health check response formats across all agents
5. Update agent-specific documentation
