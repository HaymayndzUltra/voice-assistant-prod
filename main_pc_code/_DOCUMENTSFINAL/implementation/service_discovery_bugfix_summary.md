# Service Discovery Bug Fix Summary

## Issue
The UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent was timing out when attempting to register with the SystemDigitalTwin using the service discovery mechanism. This was causing registration failure and preventing agents from discovering each other.

## Root Causes

Several issues were found and addressed:

1. **Message Format Mismatch**: The SystemDigitalTwin agent was using `socket.recv_string()` to receive messages, which works for simple string messages but not for JSON data (especially when secure ZMQ is enabled).

2. **Network Connectivity**: The service discovery client was attempting to connect to an incorrect IP address instead of using localhost when testing locally.

3. **Socket Error Handling**: Error handling in the SystemDigitalTwin was insufficient, causing issues with secure ZMQ communication.

4. **ZMQ Authenticator Initialization**: The authenticator was not properly started before secure ZMQ communication.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. SystemDigitalTwin Server Improvements

- Modified the message receiving logic to handle both secure and non-secure ZMQ communications:
  ```python
  # Changed from using socket.recv_string() to socket.recv()
  raw_message = self.socket.recv()
  ```

- Added robust error handling for different message formats:
  ```python
  try:
      message_str = raw_message.decode('utf-8')
      # Handle text messages
  except UnicodeDecodeError:
      # Handle binary messages (secure ZMQ)
  ```

- Improved ZMQ authenticator initialization:
  ```python
  # Ensure authenticator is started before configuring secure socket
  start_auth()
  self.socket = configure_secure_server(self.socket)
  ```

### 2. Service Discovery Client Improvements

- Added support for manually specified SDT addresses:
  ```python
  def _create_sdt_socket(timeout_ms: int = 5000, manual_sdt_address: str = None)
  ```

- Added automatic localhost fallback for local development:
  ```python
  if this_machine == "MainPC" or (os.environ.get("FORCE_LOCAL_SDT", "0") == "1"):
      # If we're on MainPC, use localhost for better reliability
      local_port = sdt_address.split(":")[-1]
      sdt_address = f"tcp://localhost:{local_port}"
  ```

- Improved message sending logic for secure ZMQ:
  ```python
  if secure_zmq:
      # For secure connections, send as bytes
      socket.send(request_json.encode('utf-8'))
  else:
      # For non-secure connections, use send_json
      socket.send_json(request)
  ```

### 3. UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent Improvements

- Added retry mechanism for service registration:
  ```python
  for attempt in range(1, max_retries + 1):
      # Attempt registration
      # Retry with delay if failed
  ```

- Added explicit support for local SDT mode:
  ```python
  if os.environ.get("FORCE_LOCAL_SDT", "0") == "1":
      manual_sdt_address = "tcp://localhost:7120"
  ```

## Testing and Verification

A comprehensive test script (`scripts/test_fixed_service_discovery.py`) was created to verify the fix, which:

1. Starts the SystemDigitalTwin agent
2. Starts the UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent
3. Monitors logs for successful registration
4. Performs diagnostics if registration fails

The fix was tested and verified with both:
- Standard ZMQ mode
- Secure ZMQ mode (with CURVE authentication)

## Additional Improvements

1. **Better Diagnostics**: Added more detailed logging to help diagnose future issues
2. **Environment Variables**: Added control variables like `FORCE_LOCAL_SDT` to override network configuration
3. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Added fallback mechanisms if secure ZMQ is not available
4. **Connection Verification**: Optional ping test to verify connection before sending actual requests

## Conclusion

The service discovery mechanism now works reliably in both local and distributed environments, with or without secure ZMQ. This allows agents to register their services and discover each other at runtime without requiring static configuration.
