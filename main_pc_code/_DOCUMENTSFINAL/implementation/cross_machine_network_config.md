# Cross-Machine Network Configuration Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the centralized network configuration system for cross-machine communication between MainPC and PC2.

## Implementation Overview

The implementation consists of several components:

1. **Central Network Configuration File** - YAML file for machine IP configuration
2. **Network Utilities** - Functions to load and access the network configuration 
3. **Agent Refactoring** - Updated agents to use the new network configuration
4. **Secure ZMQ Communications** - Added secure communication between machines

## Components

### 1. Central Network Configuration File

**File**: `/config/network_config.yaml`

This YAML file stores the IP addresses of the machines in the system:

```yaml
# Central network configuration for the AI System
# These are the actual IP addresses of the machines

main_pc_ip: "192.168.100.16"  # MainPC's IP address
pc2_ip: "192.168.100.17"      # PC2's IP address

# System-wide service ports
ports:
  system_digital_twin: 7120
  health_check: 8100
  unified_memory_reasoning: 7230  # Example port for UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent
```

### 2. Network Utilities

**File**: `/main_pc_code/utils/network_utils.py`

This module provides functions to:
- Load the network configuration from YAML
- Determine addresses for services on MainPC and PC2
- Detect the current machine (MainPC or PC2)
- Build ZMQ connection strings for agents

Key functions:
- `load_network_config()`
- `get_mainpc_address(service_name=None)`
- `get_pc2_address(service_name=None)`
- `get_current_machine()`

### 3. Agent Refactoring (Proof of Concept)

The `UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent` was refactored to use the new network configuration system:

**File**: `/pc2_code/agents/UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent.py`

The agent now:
- Imports the network utilities
- Uses the `get_mainpc_address()` function to find the SystemDigitalTwin
- Registers itself with the SystemDigitalTwin on MainPC

### 4. Secure ZMQ Communications

**File**: `/main_pc_code/src/network/secure_zmq.py`

To ensure secure communication between machines:
- ZMQ CURVE security is implemented for authentication and encryption
- Certificate generation script is provided in `/scripts/generate_zmq_certificates.py`
- Environment variable `SECURE_ZMQ=1` enables security

## Testing

Several test scripts were created to validate the implementation:

1. `scripts/secure_sdt_client.py` - Tests connections to SystemDigitalTwin
2. `scripts/test_sdt_security.py` - Tests the security implementation
3. `scripts/test_unified_memory_agent.py` - Tests UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent's connection to SystemDigitalTwin

## Cross-Machine Communication Flow

1. UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent (on PC2) loads network configuration
2. UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent resolves SystemDigitalTwin's address (on MainPC)
3. If secure ZMQ is enabled, ZMQ CURVE security is configured with certificates
4. UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent connects to SystemDigitalTwin 
5. UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent registers with SystemDigitalTwin
6. SystemDigitalTwin maintains a registry of all agent statuses

## Next Steps

The implementation provides a proof of concept with one agent (UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent) connecting to SystemDigitalTwin. Next steps include:

1. Refactoring additional agents to use the new network configuration system
2. Implementing service discovery for additional services
3. Enhancing the security model with certificate rotation
4. Implementing network failure detection and recovery

## Deployment Requirements

1. Both machines must have the correct `/config/network_config.yaml` file
2. For secure communication, both machines must have matching certificates in `/certificates`
3. The `SECURE_ZMQ` environment variable must be set consistently on both machines
