# Memory System Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating from the current fragmented memory systems to the new centralized Memory Orchestrator. The migration will follow a phased approach to minimize disruption to the voice assistant's operations and ensure data integrity throughout the process.

## Current Memory Systems

The voice assistant currently uses multiple independent memory components:

1. **SessionMemoryAgent**: Stores conversation history and session data for the main PC
2. **contextual_memory_pc2**: Maintains contextual information on PC2
3. **jarvis_memory_pc2**: Stores user preferences and persistent knowledge on PC2

These systems operate independently, resulting in data silos, potential inconsistencies, and inefficient memory retrieval.

## Target Architecture

The target architecture centralizes all memory operations through the Memory Orchestrator:

1. **Memory Orchestrator Service**: Central service exposing a unified API
2. **PostgreSQL Database**: Backend storage with vector search capabilities
3. **Client Libraries**: Wrapper libraries for agents to interact with the Memory Orchestrator

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Co-existence (Week 1-2)

During this phase, we'll set up the new infrastructure while keeping the existing systems operational.

#### Tasks:

1. **Database Setup**
   - Deploy PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
   - Create schema according to `memory_db_schema.md`
   - Set up replication and backup systems
   - Configure user permissions and security

2. **Memory Orchestrator Service Implementation**
   - Implement service according to `memory_orchestrator_api.md`
   - Deploy on port 5570 with ZMQ REP socket
   - Implement health monitoring and logging
   - Create basic admin interface for monitoring

3. **Initial Data Seeding**
   - Develop one-time migration scripts for each existing memory system
   - Import historical data from all three memory systems
   - Validate data integrity and generate embeddings
   - Create documentation of the imported data

4. **Client Library Development**
   - Create Python client library for agents to use
   - Implement connection pooling and error handling
   - Add telemetry for monitoring integration success
   - Create unit tests for the client library

#### Validation Criteria:

- Memory Orchestrator responds to all API requests accurately
- Historical data is successfully migrated and queryable
- Performance benchmarks show acceptable latency for core operations
- Test suite passes with >95% coverage

### Phase 2: Dual-Write Implementation (Week 3-4)

In this phase, we'll modify agents to write to both the old and new memory systems, ensuring data consistency without depending on the new system yet.

#### Tasks:

1. **Modify SessionMemoryAgent**
   - Implement dual-write capability
   - Add configuration toggle for dual-write mode
   - Update agent to log success/failure of both writes
   - Implement periodic data consistency checks

2. **Modify contextual_memory_pc2**
   - Add dual-write functionality
   - Ensure vector embeddings are generated for the new system
   - Create monitoring for embedding generation
   - Implement fallback mechanism if orchestrator is unavailable

3. **Modify jarvis_memory_pc2**
   - Update preference storage to use dual-write
   - Ensure user profile data is synced to the new system
   - Add verification of write operations
   - Monitor performance impact of dual-writes

4. **Operational Monitoring**
   - Set up dashboards for comparing data between systems
   - Implement alerting for inconsistencies
   - Create daily reconciliation report
   - Monitor system performance impact

#### Validation Criteria:

- All memory write operations successfully recorded in both systems
- Data consistency checks pass with 100% accuracy
- Performance impact is within acceptable limits (<50ms additional latency)
- Error handling correctly manages failed writes

### Phase 3: Read Migration (Week 5-6)

In this phase, we'll gradually shift read operations to the new Memory Orchestrator while continuing dual-writes.

#### Tasks:

1. **Modify Memory Read Operations in SessionMemoryAgent**
   - Implement feature flag for reading from new orchestrator
   - Add shadow reads (read from both, compare results)
   - Create metrics for read consistency and performance
   - Gradually increase percentage of reads from new system

2. **Update contextual_memory_pc2 Read Operations**
   - Implement similarity search through Memory Orchestrator
   - Compare results with existing system for accuracy
   - Monitor performance of semantic searches
   - Implement gradual migration of read traffic

3. **Update jarvis_memory_pc2 Read Operations**
   - Implement read operations through new orchestrator
   - Add fallback to old system if new system fails
   - Create logging for read patterns and performance
   - Update preferences retrieval to use new system

4. **Testing and Verification**
   - Conduct extensive A/B testing between systems
   - Perform load testing on the new orchestrator
   - Verify all error handling paths
   - Create automated consistency checks

#### Validation Criteria:

- Read operations return identical results from both systems
- Semantic search provides equal or better results than current system
- Read latency is equal to or better than existing system
- System remains stable under peak load conditions

### Phase 4: Full Migration and Decommissioning (Week 7-8)

In this final phase, we'll complete the migration by removing the dual-write approach and decommissioning the old memory systems.

#### Tasks:

1. **Complete Write Migration**
   - Remove dual-write code, fully commit to new orchestrator
   - Perform final data reconciliation
   - Update all configuration to use new system only
   - Monitor for any issues after the switch

2. **Decommission Old Memory Systems**
   - Create final backups of all old memory systems
   - Update documentation to reflect new architecture
   - Reallocate resources from old systems
   - Keep old systems in read-only mode for 2 weeks

3. **Optimize Memory Orchestrator**
   - Fine-tune database performance based on real usage
   - Optimize vector search parameters
   - Implement advanced caching if needed
   - Review and adjust resource allocation

4. **Training and Documentation**
   - Update all developer documentation
   - Create troubleshooting guides
   - Conduct training sessions for the team
   - Document lessons learned from the migration

#### Validation Criteria:

- All agents successfully using only the new Memory Orchestrator
- No degradation in system performance or capabilities
- Complete documentation updated and available
- Monitoring shows stable operation with acceptable resource usage

## Rollback Plan

A detailed rollback plan is essential to ensure system reliability during migration.

### Rollback Triggers:

- Data inconsistency exceeding 0.1% between systems
- Performance degradation exceeding 100ms for critical operations
- Error rate exceeding 1% for memory operations
- Functional regressions in voice assistant capabilities

### Rollback Process:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Disable feature flags for the new orchestrator
   - Revert to using only the original memory systems
   - Alert development team and stakeholders
   - Capture diagnostic information

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and telemetry data
   - Identify root cause of issues
   - Develop and test fixes in isolation
   - Update migration plan based on findings

3. **Resolution**
   - Apply fixes to the Memory Orchestrator
   - Conduct thorough testing of resolved issues
   - Update documentation with lessons learned
   - Resume migration with revised approach
