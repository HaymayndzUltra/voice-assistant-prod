# Group: Utilities Support (Deprecated)

**Note: This group has been deprecated. All agents previously in this group have been moved to the utility_services group for better logical organization.**

Please refer to the [Utility Services](03_utility_services.md) documentation for information about these agents:

- PredictiveHealthMonitor
- FixedStreamingTranslation
- Executor
- TinyLlamaServiceEnhanced
- LocalFineTunerAgent
- NLLBAdapter

This reorganization is part of the revised agent grouping structure that better reflects logical service boundaries in the system architecture.
