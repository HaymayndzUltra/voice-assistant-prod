# MVS Status Report

## Implementation Summary

The Minimal Viable System (MVS) implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Configuration**

   - `minimal_system_config.yaml`: Defines the core agents and dependencies
   - Contains port configurations and agent relationships

2. **Launch Scripts**

   - `launch_mvs.py`: Basic launcher script
   - `launch_mvs_improved.py`: Enhanced launcher with better error handling and path resolution
   - `run_mvs.sh`: Shell script wrapper for environment setup and launching

3. **Monitoring Tools**

   - `check_mvs_health.py`: Health check script to verify agent status
   - Includes detailed reporting capabilities

4. **Documentation**
   - `README.md`: Overview of the MVS
   - `mvs_installation.md`: Installation instructions
   - `mvs_troubleshooting.md`: Troubleshooting guide
   - `PROJECT_CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md`: Plan for future development

## Current Issues

1. **Agent File Path Resolution**

   - The system cannot locate agent implementation files
   - File paths in the configuration may not match the actual file structure
   - Need to verify the existence and correct paths for all agent files

2. **Configuration Path Issues**

   - Scripts have difficulty locating the configuration file
   - Multiple path resolution attempts have been implemented

3. **Health Check Reliability**
   - Original health check script was getting stuck
   - Improved version with timeouts and better error handling
   - Still needs testing with actual running agents

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Agent Files**

   - Confirm the existence and correct paths of all agent files
   - Update configuration with correct paths

2. **Test Launch Script**

   - Run the improved launcher with check-only mode
   - Verify that all agent files can be found

3. **Incremental Testing**

   - Start with launching a single agent
   - Gradually add more agents while monitoring stability

4. **Documentation Update**
   - Update documentation based on findings
   - Add troubleshooting steps for common issues

## Technical Debt

1. **Path Handling**

   - Improve path resolution across all scripts
   - Consider using relative paths consistently

2. **Error Handling**

   - Enhance error reporting and recovery
   - Add more detailed logging

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Consider a more robust configuration system
   - Implement validation for configuration entries

## Conclusion

The MVS implementation provides a foundation for the AI system but requires further refinement to ensure reliable operation. The focus should be on resolving path issues and verifying agent implementations before proceeding with full system deployment.
