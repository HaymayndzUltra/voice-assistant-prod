# Phase 2: Distributed Memory System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation details for Phase 2 of our system refactoring: the Distributed Memory System. This phase focuses on creating a robust, centralized memory architecture that can be accessed by all agents across the distributed system.

## Architecture

The memory system follows a client-server architecture:

1. **Memory Orchestrator Service (Server)**: Central service running on PC2 that manages all memory operations
2. **Memory Client (Client)**: Lightweight client that agents use to interact with the Memory Orchestrator
3. **Memory Scheduler**: Background service that handles memory maintenance tasks
4. **System Health Manager**: Monitors the health of memory system components

## Implementation Phases

### Phase A: Core Infrastructure Setup

- [x] Enhanced database schema for hierarchical memory relationships

### Phase C: Agent Migration

- [x] Knowledge Base Agent updated to use MemoryClient
  - Removed direct database access
  - Added standardized error reporting

  - Implemented semantic search capabilities

- [x] Session Memory Agent fully migrated
  - Completed MemoryClient integration
  - Migrated session data to central memory system
  - Updated API methods to use orchestrator
  - Added proper error handling and reporting

- [x] Context Manager Agent created
  - Provides context management across sessions
  - Uses central memory system via MemoryClient
  - Implements caching for performance optimization
  - Supports semantic search for context retrieval

- [x] Standardized Memory Access Patterns
  - Consistent error handling across all agents
  - Unified memory access through MemoryClient
  - Standardized response formats
  - Circuit breaker pattern for resilience

## API Reference

### Memory Client API

The MemoryClient provides the following methods for interacting with the memory system:

```python
# Identity Management
set_agent_id(agent_id: str) -> None
set_session_id(session_id: str) -> None

# Session Management
create_session(user_id: str, session_type: str = "conversation", 
               session_metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Memory Operations
add_memory(content: str, memory_type: str = "general", memory_tier: str = "short", 
           importance: float = 0.5, metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, 
           tags: Optional[List[str]] = None, parent_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]

get_memory(memory_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]

search_memory(query: str, memory_type: Optional[str] = None, 
              limit: int = 10, parent_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]

semantic_search(query: str, k: int = 5, 
                filters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]

update_memory(memory_id: str, update_payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]

delete_memory(memory_id: str, cascade: bool = True) -> Dict[str, Any]

get_children(parent_id: str, limit: int = 50, 
             sort_field: str = "created_at", 
             sort_order: str = "desc") -> Dict[str, Any]

# Relationships
add_relationship(source_id: str, target_id: str, relationship_type: str, 
                 strength: float = 1.0) -> Dict[str, Any]

get_related_memories(memory_id: str, relationship_type: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Memory Reinforcement
reinforce_memory(memory_id: str, reinforcement_factor: float = 1.2) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Batch Operations
batch_add_memories(memories: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]
batch_get_memories(memory_ids: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Context Groups
create_context_group(name: str, description: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]
add_to_group(memory_id: str, group_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]
get_memories_by_group(group_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Circuit Breaker Management
get_circuit_breaker_status() -> Dict[str, Any]
reset_circuit_breaker() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

## Configuration

The memory system is configured through `memory_config.yaml`, which includes settings for:

- Database connection parameters
- Redis cache configuration
- Memory decay parameters
- Circuit breaker settings
- Logging configuration

## Error Handling

All memory operations include standardized error handling:

1. Errors are reported to the central error bus
2. Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures
3. Automatic reconnection logic handles temporary network issues
4. Consistent error response format across all operations

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of remaining agents to use MemoryClient
2. Implement advanced memory analytics
3. Add memory visualization tools for debugging
4. Enhance semantic search capabilities
