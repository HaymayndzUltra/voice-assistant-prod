# PHASE 1 COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION COMMAND FOR O3-PRO MAX

## 🎯 PROJECT CONTEXT & CRITICAL SITUATION

**CURRENT STATUS**: Phase 1 consolidation is severely incomplete (20-30% implementation only)

**TARGET**: Consolidate 15 agents → 5 unified services per PLAN.MD/4_proposal.md specification

**CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**:
- CoreOrchestrator missing 80% of source agent logic
- ObservabilityHub missing 70% of PC2 monitoring logic  
- 3 complete services missing (ResourceManager+Scheduler, ErrorBus, SecurityGateway)
- No actual logic preservation - only basic facade patterns implemented

**SUCCESS REQUIREMENT**: 100% logic preservation from all 15 source agents
