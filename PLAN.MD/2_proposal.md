DISTRIBUTED AI SYSTEM ARCHITECTURAL CONSOLIDATION PROPOSAL
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
After comprehensive analysis of the 80+ agent system distributed across MainPC (RTX 4090) and PC2 (RTX 3060), I've identified significant architectural redundancies and inefficiencies.

Target State: 30 unified agents (20 MainPC, 10 PC2)
Reduction: 54 agents eliminated through intelligent consolidation
Benefits: Simplified dependencies, improved performance, easier maintenance
