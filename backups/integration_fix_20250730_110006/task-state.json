Your goal is to identify all potential candidates for cleanup, including orphan files, unused code, and redundant assets. Consolidate all your findings into a single, detailed markdown report named 'cleanup_plan.md'. This report must categorize each item with a proposed action ([DELETE], [REFACTOR], [ARCHIVE]) and provide a clear, evidence-based justification for each proposal. Do not modify or delete any files in this phase.\"",
