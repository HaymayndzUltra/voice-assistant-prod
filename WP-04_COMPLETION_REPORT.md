## ðŸ“Š **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **orjson Performance Optimization**
```python
# Before (standard json)
data = json.loads(content)
result = json.dumps(data)

# After (orjson with fallback)
try:
    import orjson
    json_loads = orjson.loads
    json_dumps = lambda obj, **kwargs: orjson.dumps(obj).decode()
except ImportError:
    import json
    json_loads = json.loads
    json_dumps = json.dumps
```

### **Async I/O Performance Pattern**
```python
# Sync file operations (blocking)
with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

# Async file operations (non-blocking)
async with aiofiles.open(file_path, 'r') as f:
    content = await f.read()
```

### **Redis Caching Architecture**
```
Local LRU Cache (10K entries, 1-hour TTL)
    â†“ (cache miss)
Redis Distributed Cache (persistent, configurable TTL)
    â†“ (cache miss)
Source Function (database, API, computation)
    â†“
Cache Results (both local and Redis)
```

### **Connection Pool Configuration**
```python
RedisConnectionPool(
    max_connections=50,
    socket_keepalive=True,
    health_check_interval=30s,
    retry_on_timeout=True,
    connection_timeout=5s
)
