# Multi-Agent Protocol Implementation Guide
**Practical Application of the Multi-Agent Collaboration Protocol**

---

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Basic Three-Agent Analysis

```bash
# Initialize environment
mkdir -p /memory-bank/multi-agent
cd /memory-bank/multi-agent

# Create problem statement
cat > problem.md << 'EOF'
# Problem: Production System Failure Analysis
## Context
The production system experienced 3 outages in the last week.
## Objectives
1. Identify root causes
2. Propose preventive measures
3. Create incident response plan
EOF

# Deploy to agents (manual approach)
for AGENT in ALPHA BETA GAMMA; do
  cursor-agent --background \
    --name "$AGENT" \
    --task "Analyze problem.md" \
    --output "/memory-bank/multi-agent/$AGENT/" &
done
```

### 2. Using the Python Orchestrator

```bash
# Run automated orchestration
python3 multi-agent-orchestrator.py \
  --agents ALPHA BETA GAMMA \
  --timeout 45 \
  --strategy TIE_BREAKER

# View results
cat /memory-bank/multi-agent/MA-*/FINAL_PLAN_*.md
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Security Vulnerability Assessment

**Problem Statement:**
```json
{
  "context": "Critical security vulnerabilities detected in container infrastructure",
  "objectives": [
    "Identify all attack vectors",
    "Assess current security posture",
    "Prioritize remediation by risk"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Zero-downtime requirement",
    "Compliance with SOC2 standards",
    "Complete assessment in 48 hours"
  ]
}
```

**Agent Specialization:**
- **ALPHA**: Focus on network security
- **BETA**: Focus on container security
- **GAMMA**: Focus on application security

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Unanimous findings: Critical vulnerabilities
- Complementary findings: Domain-specific issues
- Conflicts: Risk severity assessments

### Scenario 2: Performance Optimization

**Problem Statement:**
```json
{
  "context": "System performance degraded by 40% after latest deployment",
  "objectives": [
    "Identify performance bottlenecks",
    "Compare with baseline metrics",
    "Recommend optimization strategies"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Maintain feature parity",
    "Budget: $10,000",
    "Timeline: 1 week"
  ]
}
```

**Conflict Resolution Example:**
```json
{
  "conflict": "Database optimization approach",
  "agent_positions": {
    "ALPHA": "Implement caching layer",
    "BETA": "Optimize queries and indexes",
    "GAMMA": "Scale database horizontally"
  },
  "resolution": {
    "method": "EVIDENCE_BASED",
    "outcome": "BETA's approach adopted",
    "justification": "Query analysis showed 80% improvement potential"
  }
}
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Weighted Agent Expertise

```python
# Assign expertise weights for domain-specific problems
AGENT_EXPERTISE = {
    "ALPHA": {
        "security": 0.9,
        "performance": 0.6,
        "architecture": 0.7
    },
    "BETA": {
        "security": 0.7,
        "performance": 0.9,
        "architecture": 0.8
    },
    "GAMMA": {
        "security": 0.8,
        "performance": 0.7,
        "architecture": 0.9
    }
}

def weighted_consensus(findings, domain):
    """Calculate consensus with expertise weighting"""
    weighted_scores = {}
    for agent, finding in findings.items():
        weight = AGENT_EXPERTISE[agent][domain]
        weighted_scores[finding] = weighted_scores.get(finding, 0) + weight
    return max(weighted_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
```

### 2. Dynamic Agent Allocation

```python
def allocate_agents_by_complexity(problem_complexity):
    """Dynamically determine number of agents needed"""
    if problem_complexity == "LOW":
        return ["ALPHA", "BETA"]  # 2 agents sufficient
    elif problem_complexity == "MEDIUM":
        return ["ALPHA", "BETA", "GAMMA"]  # Standard 3 agents
    else:  # HIGH
        return ["ALPHA", "BETA", "GAMMA", "DELTA", "EPSILON"]  # 5 agents
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement

```python
async def iterative_analysis(orchestrator, max_iterations=3):
    """Run multiple analysis iterations for complex problems"""
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        print(f"Iteration {iteration + 1}")
        
        # Run analysis
        await orchestrator.execute_phase1_analysis()
        synthesis = orchestrator.execute_phase2_synthesis()
        
        # Check consensus threshold
        consensus_rate = calculate_consensus_rate(synthesis)
        if consensus_rate > 0.85:
            print("High consensus achieved")
            break
        
        # Refine problem statement based on findings
        refine_problem_statement(synthesis)
```

---

## Conflict Resolution Patterns

### Pattern 1: Hierarchical Arbitration

```python
ARBITRATION_HIERARCHY = [
    ("EXPERT_OPINION", lambda c: c["requires_domain_expertise"]),
    ("EVIDENCE_BASED", lambda c: c["has_reproducible_evidence"]),
    ("TIE_BREAKER", lambda c: len(c["agents"]) == 2),
    ("DEFERRED", lambda c: True)  # Default fallback
]

def select_resolution_strategy(conflict):
    """Select appropriate resolution strategy based on conflict characteristics"""
    for strategy, condition in ARBITRATION_HIERARCHY:
        if condition(conflict):
            return strategy
    return "DEFERRED"
```

### Pattern 2: Consensus Building

```markdown
## Consensus Building Process

1. **Initial Positions**
   - Each agent presents their finding with evidence
   - Confidence scores recorded

2. **Evidence Exchange**
   - Agents review each other's evidence
   - Request clarifications
   - Identify common ground

3. **Position Refinement**
   - Agents may adjust positions based on new evidence
   - Document reasoning for changes

4. **Final Vote**
   - If consensus > 66%, adopt majority position
   - If consensus < 66%, escalate to expert review
```

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Pre-Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Problem statement is clear and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] All agents have identical access to resources
- [ ] Time limits are appropriate for problem complexity
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy is predetermined

### 2. Post-Analysis Validation

```python
def validate_analysis_quality(synthesis):
    """Validate the quality of multi-agent analysis"""
    quality_metrics = {
        "coverage": calculate_coverage(synthesis),
        "consensus_rate": calculate_consensus_rate(synthesis),
        "false_positive_rate": estimate_false_positives(synthesis),
        "blind_spot_detection": count_complementary_findings(synthesis)
    }
    
    quality_gates = {
        "coverage": 0.95,
        "consensus_rate": 0.70,
        "false_positive_rate": 0.05,
        "blind_spot_detection": 1  # At least 1 per agent
    }
    
    for metric, value in quality_metrics.items():
        threshold = quality_gates[metric]
        if metric == "false_positive_rate":
            passed = value <= threshold
        else:
            passed = value >= threshold
        
        print(f"{metric}: {value:.2f} ({'PASS' if passed else 'FAIL'})")
    
    return all_quality_gates_passed(quality_metrics, quality_gates)
```

### 3. Continuous Improvement

```python
class AnalysisMetricsCollector:
    """Collect metrics for continuous improvement"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.sessions = []
    
    def record_session(self, session_data):
        metrics = {
            "session_id": session_data["session_id"],
            "agent_count": len(session_data["agents"]),
            "execution_time": session_data["execution_time"],
            "consensus_rate": session_data["consensus_rate"],
            "conflicts_resolved": session_data["conflicts_resolved"],
            "implementation_success": None  # Track later
        }
        self.sessions.append(metrics)
    
    def analyze_trends(self):
        """Identify patterns and improvement opportunities"""
        # Calculate average consensus by agent count
        # Identify most effective conflict resolution strategies
        # Track implementation success rates
        pass
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Agent Timeout | Analysis incomplete after time limit | Increase timeout or reduce problem scope |
| Low Consensus | <50% agreement between agents | Clarify problem statement, add constraints |
| Cascading Failures | One agent failure affects others | Implement circuit breakers, use async execution |
| Resource Contention | Agents competing for same resources | Implement resource locking, use read-only access |
| Inconsistent Results | Different results on re-run | Ensure deterministic analysis, fix random seeds |

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check agent status
for AGENT in ALPHA BETA GAMMA; do
  echo "=== $AGENT ==="
  cat /memory-bank/multi-agent/*/$AGENT/status.txt
done

# Verify problem distribution
md5sum /memory-bank/multi-agent/*/input/problem.json

# Monitor real-time progress
watch -n 5 'ls -la /memory-bank/multi-agent/*/output/'

# Analyze consensus patterns
python3 -c "
import json
with open('synthesis.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    print(f\"Unanimous: {len(data['consensus']['unanimous'])}\")
    print(f\"Majority: {len(data['consensus']['majority'])}\")
    print(f\"Conflicts: {len(data['conflicts'])}\")
"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Problem Statement Design

✅ **DO:**
- Use specific, measurable objectives
- Include all relevant constraints
- Define clear success criteria
- Provide necessary context

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use vague or ambiguous language
- Include solution hints or bias
- Mix multiple unrelated problems
- Assume implicit knowledge

### 2. Agent Configuration

✅ **DO:**
- Use odd number of agents (3, 5, 7) for tie-breaking
- Ensure identical tool access
- Set appropriate timeouts
- Isolate agent environments

❌ **DON'T:**
- Share state between agents during Phase 1
- Use different tool versions
- Allow unlimited execution time
- Let agents see each other's work prematurely

### 3. Conflict Resolution

✅ **DO:**
- Document all dissenting opinions
- Use evidence-based approaches
- Maintain audit trail
- Consider partial agreement

❌ **DON'T:**
- Ignore minority viewpoints
- Force artificial consensus
- Defer all conflicts
- Discard contradicting evidence

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Parallel Execution

```python
# Maximize parallelization
async def parallel_analysis_with_batching(agents, batch_size=3):
    """Run agents in parallel batches for resource optimization"""
    results = []
    for i in range(0, len(agents), batch_size):
        batch = agents[i:i+batch_size]
        batch_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
            run_agent_analysis(agent) for agent in batch
        ])
        results.extend(batch_results)
    return results
```

### 2. Caching Strategies

```python
# Cache common analysis patterns
ANALYSIS_CACHE = {}

def cached_analysis(problem_hash, agent_name):
    cache_key = f"{problem_hash}:{agent_name}"
    if cache_key in ANALYSIS_CACHE:
        print(f"Using cached analysis for {agent_name}")
        return ANALYSIS_CACHE[cache_key]
    
    result = perform_analysis(problem_hash, agent_name)
    ANALYSIS_CACHE[cache_key] = result
    return result
```

### 3. Resource Management

```python
# Implement resource pooling
class ResourcePool:
    def __init__(self, max_concurrent=3):
        self.semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent)
    
    async def run_with_limit(self, coro):
        async with self.semaphore:
            return await coro
```
