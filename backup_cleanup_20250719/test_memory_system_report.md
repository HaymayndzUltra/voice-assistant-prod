## Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Database Operations**: Under high load, SQLite operations become a bottleneck. Consider implementing connection pooling or migrating to a more scalable database solution for production.

2. **Memory Search**: Text-based search becomes slower as the database grows. Consider implementing vector-based semantic search with proper indexing for improved performance.

3. **Cross-Machine Latency**: While acceptable for most operations, the network latency between MainPC and PC2 can impact performance during high-throughput scenarios. Consider implementing more aggressive caching strategies.

## Recommendations

1. **Database Optimization**:
   - Implement proper indexing on frequently queried fields
   - Consider connection pooling for concurrent access
   - Evaluate migration to PostgreSQL for higher throughput

2. **Caching Improvements**:
   - Increase cache TTL for frequently accessed, rarely changing data
   - Implement hierarchical caching strategy
   - Add memory usage monitoring to prevent cache overflow

3. **Search Optimization**:
   - Implement full-text search capabilities
   - Add vector embeddings for semantic search
   - Create specialized indices for different query patterns

4. **Resilience Enhancements**:
   - Improve circuit breaker configuration with more granular settings
   - Add automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
   - Implement more comprehensive health checks

## Conclusion

The memory system meets the functional requirements specified in the project documentation. It demonstrates good performance characteristics under normal load conditions and acceptable degradation under high load. The system shows proper error handling and recovery capabilities.

The identified bottlenecks should be addressed in future iterations to improve scalability, but they do not represent critical issues for the current usage patterns.

Overall, the memory system is ready for production use with the recommended optimizations planned for future releases.
