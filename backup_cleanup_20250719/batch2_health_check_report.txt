## REFACTORING CAMPAIGN: Health Check Implementation (Phase 2 - Batch 2)

### SUMMARY REPORT

#### COMPLETED BATCH 2 REFACTORING

All 10 target files have been successfully modified to include the standardized `_get_health_status` method as required by Compliance Criterion C4.

#### MODIFIED FILES:

1. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/mood_tracker_agent.py`
2. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/unified_planning_agent.py`
3. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/MultiAgentSwarmManager.py`
4. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/unified_system_agent.py`
5. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/tts_connector.py`
6. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/tts_cache.py`
7. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/streaming_tts_agent.py`
8. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/tts_agent.py`
9. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/streaming_interrupt_handler.py`
10. `/home/haymayndz/AI_System_Monorepo/main_pc_code/agents/code_generator_agent.py`

#### IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

The following standardized `_get_health_status` method was added to each agent class:

```python
def _get_health_status(self):
    # Default health status: Agent is running if its main loop is active.
    # This can be expanded with more specific checks later.
    status = "HEALTHY" if self.running else "UNHEALTHY"
    details = {
        "status_message": "Agent is operational.",
        "uptime_seconds": time.time() - self.start_time if hasattr(self, 'start_time') else 0
    }
    return {"status": status, "details": details}
```

#### EXAMPLE DIFF (unified_planning_agent.py):

```diff
+    def _get_health_status(self):
+        # Default health status: Agent is running if its main loop is active.
+        # This can be expanded with more specific checks later.
+        status = "HEALTHY" if self.running else "UNHEALTHY"
+        details = {
+            "status_message": "Agent is operational.",
+            "uptime_seconds": time.time() - self.start_time if hasattr(self, 'start_time') else 0
+        }
+        return {"status": status, "details": details}
```

#### IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

1. For some files (mood_tracker_agent.py and unified_planning_agent.py), an existing `_get_health_status` method was updated to match the standardized format.
2. Three files (MultiAgentSwarmManager.py, streaming_tts_agent.py, and code_generator_agent.py) required manual implementation due to parsing errors in the automated script.
3. All files now include the `time` module import which is required for the `time.time()` call in the health status method.
4. The implementation assumes the existence of a `self.running` flag and optionally a `self.start_time` attribute in each agent class.

#### VERIFICATION:

All 10 files were verified to contain the `_get_health_status` method using a custom verification script. The verification was successful with 10/10 files passing the check.

#### NEXT STEPS:

Proceed to the next batch of files for health check implementation as part of Phase 2 of the refactoring campaign.
