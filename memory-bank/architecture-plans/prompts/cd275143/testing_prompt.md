# Testing Prompt for: ML-based task outcome prediction and smart routing system with learning capabilities

## Testing Requirements

Create comprehensive tests for the implemented feature: ML-based task outcome prediction and smart routing system with learning capabilities

### Test Files to Create
- `test_ml-based_task_outcome_prediction_and_smart_routing_system_with_learning_capabilities.py`
- Integration tests in appropriate test directories

### Test Categories

#### 1. Unit Tests
- Test all individual functions
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test error handling paths
- Test with valid and invalid inputs

#### 2. Integration Tests
- Test interactions with existing systems
- Test CLI integration
- Test state management
- Test file operations

#### 3. Performance Tests
- Test with large datasets
- Test concurrent operations

### Testing Patterns
- Use pytest framework
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure paths

### Test Implementation
Implement all tests following the project's testing standards and patterns.
