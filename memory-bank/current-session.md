## üïí Open Tasks (Todo Manager)
- **- Phase 1: System Analysis & Cleanup
        - Inventory all existing Docker/Podman containers, images, and compose files.
        - Delete all old containers/images/compose files.
        - Identify all agent groups, dependencies, and required libraries.
    - Phase 2: Logical Grouping & Compose Generation
        - Design optimal container groupings (by function, dependency, resource needs).
        - Generate new docker-compose SoT with correct build contexts, volumes, networks, and healthchecks.
        - Ensure requirements.txt per container is minimal and correct.
    - Phase 3: Validation & Optimization
        - Build and start all containers in dependency-correct order.
        - Validate agent startup, health, and inter-container communication.
        - Optimize for image size, startup time, and resource usage.
        - Document the new architecture and compose setup.** (10 todos left)
- **I-build natin ang bagong user auth feature. First, i-update mo ang database schema, magdagdag ka ng 'users' table na may 'username' at 'password_hash' columns. Then, gawa ka ng API endpoint, sa '/login', na tatanggap ng POST requests. Kapag tama ang credentials, kailangan mag-return ito ng JWT. Kung mali naman, dapat 401 Unauthorized error ang i-return. Lastly, gawa ka ng simpleng login form sa frontend para ma-test natin yung endpoint.** (1 todos left)
- **Let's build the new user authentication feature. First of all, update the database schema to include a 'users' table with 'username' and 'password_hash' columns. Afterwards, create an API endpoint at '/login' that accepts POST requests. If the credentials are correct, it must return a JWT. If they are incorrect, it must return a 401 Unauthorized error. Finally, create a simple login form on the frontend to test the new endpoint.** (1 todos left)
- **Gawin natin ang bagong user authentication feature. Una sa lahat, i-update ang schema ng database para magkaroon ng 'users' table na may 'username' at 'password_hash' na mga column. Pagkatapos, bumuo ka ng isang API endpoint na '/login' na tumatanggap ng POST requests. Kung tama ang credentials, dapat itong magbalik ng isang JWT. Kung mali, dapat itong magbalik ng 401 Unauthorized error. Panghuli, gumawa ka ng isang simpleng login form sa frontend para i-test ang bagong endpoint.** (2 todos left)

    Complete Backend API Development:
    
    Phase 1 - Foundation (parallel execution possible):
    - Setup mo ang database schema at migrations
    - Configure authentication middleware 
    - I-implement ang basic CRUD operations
    
    Phase 2 - Features (conditional on Phase 1):
    Kung successful ang foundation setup:
    - Add advanced search functionality
    - Implement caching layer
    - Create API documentation
    
    Phase 3 - Testing & Deployment:
    Una, run comprehensive test suite.
    Kung lahat ng tests ay passing, deploy sa staging.
    Panghuli, if staging validation succeeds, deploy to production.

# üöÄ TOP-LEVEL GOAL
Perform a complete refactoring of the containerized agent infrastructure, from analysis and cleanup to generation, validation, and documentation of a new, optimized deployment.
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ CONTEXT
Codebase location: The entire project repository, focusing on Docker/Podman assets and agent configurations.
Current state or pain-point: The existing container setup may be outdated, inefficient, or contain unused assets. A clean, optimized, and well-documented "Source of Truth" (SoT) for the container architecture is needed.
Relevant prior tickets / PRs / docs: This is a new, major refactoring initiative.
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ DELIVERABLES
A new docker-compose.yml file that represents the optimized "Source of Truth" for the agent deployment.
Updated requirements.txt files for each container service, ensuring they are minimal.
A new or updated markdown file (ARCHITECTURE.md or similar) documenting the new container architecture and setup.
A final report confirming the successful completion of all phases.
# 3Ô∏è‚É£ TASK BREAKDOWN (optional, but boosts accuracy)
Phase 1: System Analysis & Cleanup
Inventory all existing Docker/Podman containers, images, and compose files.
Identify and list all assets deemed "old" or "unused" for deletion.
[CONFIRMATION STEP] Pause and seek user approval before executing any destructive deletion operations.
Identify all agent groups, their dependencies, and required libraries.
Phase 2: Logical Grouping & Compose Generation
Design an optimal container grouping strategy based on function, dependency, and resource needs.
Generate the new docker-compose.yml SoT with correct build contexts, volumes, networks, and healthchecks.
Generate a minimal requirements.txt for each container.
Phase 3: Validation & Optimization
Build and start all containers in the correct dependency order using the new compose file.
Validate agent startup, health, and inter-container communication.
Analyze and apply optimizations for image size, startup time, and resource usage.
Document the new architecture and compose setup.
# 4Ô∏è‚É£ CONSTRAINTS / ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Must: The final deployment must be fully functional, with all agents passing their health checks.
Must: Explicitly ask for user confirmation before performing any destructive actions (e.g., docker rmi, rm).** (14 todos left)
- **Infrastructure Refactoring: 1. Inventory Docker assets 2. Generate docker-compose.yml 3. Validate health checks 4. Execute deployment 5. Test rollback procedures** (6 todos left)

Must: The final deployment must be fully functional, with all agents passing their health checks.
Must: Explicitly ask for user confirmation before performing any destructive actions (e.g., docker rmi, rm).
Must not: Introduce breaking changes to the core agent logic. The focus is on infrastructure, not application code.
# 5Ô∏è‚É£ RESOURCES THE AGENT MAY USE
Tools: docker, podman, python3, grep, find.
Existing scripts: memory_system/cli.py (if needed for context).
# 7Ô∏è‚É£ OUTPUT FORMAT
(D) Mixture:
For file modifications (docker-compose.yml, requirements.txt, ARCHITECTURE.md): (B) Code-edit calls (automatic patch).
For the confirmation step before deletion: (A) Inline explanation only (e.g., print the list of files to be deleted and wait for a 'yes' response).
For the final report: (A) Inline explanation only.
# 8Ô∏è‚É£ TIME / PRIORITY
Priority: High. Foundational infrastructure task.
