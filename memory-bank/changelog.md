## [2025-01-16] v3 Deployment Polish

### Added
- `README.md` summarising new v3-compatible memory architecture.
- Placeholder overrides in `config/overrides/` for machine-specific tuning.
- `requirements.base.txt` shared dependency layer and two-tier install pattern adopted by every Dockerfile.
- `docker/shared/docker-compose.gpu-override.yml` for modern GPU reservations.
- `.github/workflows/quick-smoke.yml` for fast config sanity checks.

### Changed
- All Dockerfiles now install `requirements.base.txt` first to maximise cache hits.
- Legacy memory YAML fragments removed; v3 loader is authoritative.
- `UnifiedConfigLoader` now emits `DeprecationWarning` when falling back to legacy configs.

### Removed / Archived
- Deprecated per-machine memory config fragments archived under `memory-bank/archive/`.

### Notes
This marks the completion of the v3 configuration migration for the memory
sub-system, aligning all agents with the unified loader and modern container
layouts.
