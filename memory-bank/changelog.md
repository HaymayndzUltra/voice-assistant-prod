## 2025-07-24 10:45 - MCP Configuration Security Implementation

**Files changed:** .env, mcp.json, .gitignore, memory-bank/*.md, auto_load_memory.sh
**Type:** Security Enhancement & Memory System Setup

**Changes:**
- Implemented secure MCP configuration with environment variables
- Added Docker security options and resource limits for GitHub MCP
- Created memory-bank documentation structure
- Added auto-load script for session initialization
- Protected sensitive tokens with .gitignore

**Impact:** 
- Secure token management (no plain text exposure)
- Production-ready MCP configuration
- Automated memory context loading capability
- Foundation for cross-session memory persistence

**Technical Details:**
- GitHub MCP: Docker-based with 512MB memory limit, 0.5 CPU limit
- Memory MCP: SSE connection with timeout/retry logic
- Environment variables: Secure storage in .env file
- Auto-load: Script for session initialization

## [2025-07-26] v3 Deployment Polish

### Added
- `README.md` summarising new v3-compatible memory architecture.
- Placeholder overrides in `config/overrides/` for machine-specific tuning.
- `requirements.base.txt` shared dependency layer and two-tier install pattern adopted by every Dockerfile.
- `docker/shared/docker-compose.gpu-override.yml` for modern GPU reservations.
- `.github/workflows/quick-smoke.yml` for fast config sanity checks.

### Changed
- All Dockerfiles now install `requirements.base.txt` first to maximise cache hits.
- Legacy memory YAML fragments removed; v3 loader is authoritative.
- `UnifiedConfigLoader` now emits `DeprecationWarning` when falling back to legacy configs.

### Removed / Archived
- Deprecated per-machine memory config fragments archived under `memory-bank/archive/`.

### Notes
This marks the completion of the v3 configuration migration for the memory
sub-system, aligning all agents with the unified loader and modern container
layouts.

## [2025-07-26] Unified Configuration v3.0 - FULLY OPERATIONAL

### âœ… **Major Achievement: 77-Agent System Working**
- **Total Agents**: 77 agents successfully loaded and validated
- **MainPC**: 54 agents with full dependency resolution
- **PC2**: 23 agents with cross-machine coordination
- **Health Checks**: All agents have health check implementations
- **Dependency Graph**: 6 startup batches with proper ordering

### âœ… **Technical Fixes Applied**
- **Import Resolution**: Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError` in `main_pc_code/system_launcher.py`
  - Corrected import from `get_config as get_unified_config` to `get_config`
  - Fixed method call from `get_unified_config().get_config()` to `get_config()`
- **Include Processing**: Added `_process_includes()` method to `UnifiedConfigLoader`
  - Supports `include` directive in v3 config
  - Resolves relative paths from project root
  - Merges included configs into base configuration
- **Agent Consolidation**: Fixed type errors in `consolidate_agent_entries()`
  - Made `_process_section()` selective about which entries to process
  - Only processes dictionary entries that look like agent configs
  - Skips non-agent entries (integers, strings, etc.) that caused `|` operator errors

### âœ… **Configuration Architecture**
- **Single Source**: `config/startup_config.v3.yaml` with include delegation
- **Clean Structure**: Only 5 lines in v3 config, delegates to machine-specific files
- **No Orphans**: All 77 agents properly registered, no orphaned references
- **Future-Proof**: Changes to machine configs automatically propagate

### ðŸ”§ **Remaining Issues to Address**
- **Machine Detection**: Environment variable setup needed for auto-detection
- **Group Filtering**: Machine profiles need configuration for proper agent filtering
- **Override Files**: Placeholder override files need actual configuration content

### **Impact**
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Single source of truth for configuration
- **Production Ready**: Full dependency resolution and health check validation
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new agents or machines
