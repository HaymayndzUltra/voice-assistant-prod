# Project Context - AI System Monorepo

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: AI System Monorepo
**Primary Goal**: Create a comprehensive, intelligent task management and memory system with CLI interface
**Current Status**: Architecture Mode Implementation Phase

## Scope and Vision

### Primary Objectives
1. **Intelligent Task Management**: Automated task decomposition, complexity analysis, and execution planning
2. **Memory-Driven Development**: Persistent context and knowledge management across sessions
3. **Architecture-First Workflow**: Plan-before-code approach with validation and approval steps
4. **Aggressive Autonomy**: Self-optimizing, predictive, and proactive system behavior

### Target Users
- **Primary**: AI assistant developers and power users
- **Secondary**: Development teams requiring structured task management
- **Tertiary**: Automation engineers building intelligent workflows

## Current System Capabilities

### âœ… Working Components
- **CLI Interface**: Unified memory system CLI (`memory_system/cli.py`)
- **Task Management**: Complete CRUD operations with JSON persistence
- **Workflow Intelligence**: Smart task decomposition and complexity analysis
- **State Synchronization**: Automatic sync across all state files
- **Memory Integration**: Multiple memory systems (JSON, SQLite, Markdown)
- **Health Monitoring**: System health checks and status reporting

### ðŸš§ In Development
- **Architecture Mode**: Plan-first development workflow
- **Project Brains**: Persistent knowledge maps and context management
- **Predictive Features**: Task outcome prediction and optimization
- **Advanced Autonomy**: Self-learning and adaptation capabilities

## Technical Context

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Data Storage**: JSON files, SQLite database, Markdown documentation
- **Architecture**: Modular CLI-based system with plugin architecture
- **Memory Systems**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- **AI Integration**: Ollama for LLM-based task processing

### System Architecture Patterns
- **Event-Driven**: State changes trigger automatic synchronization
- **Plugin-Based**: Modular components with clear interfaces
- **Memory-Persistent**: All context preserved across sessions
- **CLI-Centric**: Command-line interface as primary interaction method

## Business Rules and Constraints

### Data Integrity Rules
1. **Single Source of Truth**: `todo-tasks.json` is authoritative for all task data
2. **Automatic Sync**: All state files must stay synchronized automatically
3. **Backup Safety**: All changes must be backed up before modification
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System must work even if optional components fail

### Development Constraints
1. **Architecture First**: No direct coding without approved architecture plan
2. **Context Preservation**: All decisions and rationale must be documented
3. **Testing Required**: All features must have health checks and validation
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes must not break existing workflows

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Task Processing Speed**: Average time from task creation to completion
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed task executions
- **Context Retention**: Accuracy of cross-session memory preservation
- **Autonomy Level**: Percentage of tasks completed without human intervention

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Developer Experience**: Ease of use and productivity improvement
- **System Reliability**: Consistency and predictability of behavior
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Quality of long-term context retention
- **Architectural Consistency**: Adherence to established patterns

## Key Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **System Architect**: Responsible for overall system design and evolution
- **AI Assistant**: Primary user and beneficiary of the system
- **Development Team**: Contributors to system enhancement and maintenance

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **End Users**: People using the AI assistant for task management
- **System Administrators**: People maintaining and deploying the system

## Project Boundaries

### In Scope
- Task management and workflow intelligence
- Memory and context management
- CLI interface and automation
- Architecture-first development workflow
- Integration with existing AI systems

### Out of Scope
- Graphical user interfaces (GUI)
- Real-time collaboration features
- External API integrations (beyond MCP)
- Mobile applications
- Enterprise authentication systems

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity Creep**: System becoming too complex to maintain
- **Performance Degradation**: Memory usage growing unbounded
- **Integration Failures**: Problems with external dependencies
- **Data Corruption**: Loss of task or context data

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular complexity audits and refactoring
- Automated cleanup and optimization processes
- Graceful fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive backup and recovery systems

## Evolution Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- Basic CLI system
- Task management
