      [‚úó] 1. PHASE 1: System Discovery & Dependency Analysis

**Explanations:**
This phase focuses on mapping the entire system, analyzing all 77 containers, and conducting a deep dive into code dependencies. The goal is to create a complete and accurate picture of the system's current state, which is a mandatory prerequisite for any optimization.

**Technical Artifacts / Tasks:**
**1. Mandatory System Discovery (RUN FIRST):**
*CRITICAL: Execute this before any other analysis! The background agent MUST start with system discovery to know exactly where all files are located!* 
```bash
# Run the system discovery script to map the complete file structure
python system_discovery_script.py

# This will generate:
# - system_discovery_report.json (complete system mapping)
# - analysis_paths.json (specific file paths for analysis)
```

**2. System Discovery & Container Analysis:**
*   **Complete File System Mapping:** Scan the primary locations:
    ```
    ./docker/                                    # 77 Docker containers
    ./main_pc_code/agents/                      # MainPC agent source code
    ./pc2_code/agents/                          # PC2 agent source code
    ./common/                                   # Shared utilities and base classes
    ./phase1_implementation/                    # Phase implementation code
    ./scripts/                                  # Build and utility scripts
    ./requirements*.txt                         # Root-level requirements
    ./docker-compose*.yml                       # System-level compose files
    ```
*   **Container Discovery and Analysis (`./docker/*/`):**
    *   Validate each of the 77 Dockerfiles builds successfully.
    *   Check `docker-compose.yml` files for proper configuration.
    *   Verify `requirements.txt` files have no conflicting dependencies.
    *   Test container startup sequences against `startup_config.yaml`.
    *   Document any containers that fail to build or start.
    *   Validate health check endpoints respond correctly.

**3. Requirements Discovery & Completion:**
*   **Agent Code Analysis:** Scan Python files in all target locations (`./docker/*/`, `./main_pc_code/agents/*/`, `./pc2_code/agents/*/`, `./common/*/`, `./phase1_implementation/*/`) to:
    *   Trace all direct and indirect import statements.
    *   Identify missing packages not listed in `requirements.txt`.
    *   Detect unused packages listed but not imported.
    *   Generate a complete dependency tree for each agent.
*   **Requirements File Validation:** Check all `requirements.txt` files across the project to:
    *   Identify containers with missing or incomplete files.
    *   Generate missing `requirements.txt` files using static analysis.
    *   Validate all imported packages are properly versioned.
    *   Create backups of original requirements files before modification.
*   **Dynamic & Cross-Agent Dependency Mapping:**
    *   Analyze configuration files (`startup_config*.yaml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `env_config*.sh`) for runtime imports and platform-specific requirements.
    *   Map shared internal modules from `./common/*/` between agents.
    *   Create a dependency graph showing inter-agent relationships and validate startup order.

**4. Tooling for Automated Requirements Generation:**
*   Utilize `pipreqs` for basic requirements generation.
*   Implement a custom AST parser for complex import patterns.
*   Use `pip-tools` for dependency resolution and version pinning.
*   Employ `safety` for security vulnerability scanning.

**5. Requirements Validation & Testing:**
*   Test-build each container with its generated `requirements.txt`.
*   Validate all imports work correctly at runtime.
*   Check for missing system-level dependencies (e.g., apt packages).
*   Ensure version compatibility across the ecosystem.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This discovery phase is the foundation for the entire project. Inaccuracies or incomplete analysis here will lead to failures in subsequent optimization and implementation phases. Do not proceed until the current step is complete. Before moving forward, review the completed step and the next one. Repeat the review if your confidence score is below 90%.
      [‚úó] 2. PHASE 2: Optimization Strategy & Remediation Planning

**Explanations:**
Based on the findings from Phase 1, this phase involves creating a detailed strategy for all optimization and remediation tasks. This includes planning for build time reduction, performance enhancements, and infrastructure hardening. The output of this phase is a clear, prioritized action plan.

**Technical Artifacts / Tasks:**
**1. Formulate Requirements Optimization Strategy:**
*   **Duplicate Analysis:** Analyze all 77 `requirements.txt` files to find duplicate packages and version conflicts. Plan a `requirements.common.txt` for packages appearing in 10+ containers.

*   **Dependency Consolidation:** Identify containers with 80%+ requirement overlap for potential merging. Define requirement profiles (minimal, standard, full) and plan the removal of unused dependencies.
*   **Build Time Optimization:** Develop a strategy for Docker layer caching, optimized requirement installation order, and using `.dockerignore` to reduce build context.

**2. Plan Performance Optimization Implementation:**
*   **GPU Memory (PC2):** Plan the implementation of int8 quantization for NLLB models, moving TTS to CPU, and enabling predictive model unloading.
*   **Memory Leaks:** Outline the steps to fix missing `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` calls, implement context-managed tensor lifecycles, and add periodic queue purging.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:** Plan the replacement of O(N¬≤) image comparison, caching of spaCy models, fixing N+1 DB queries, and converting sync I/O to async.

**3. Plan Infrastructure Hardening & Efficiency Improvements:**

    1.  **CRITICAL:** GPU memory optimization for PC2.
    2.  **HIGH:** Requirements deduplication and build optimization.
    3.  **HIGH:** Memory leak fixes and monitoring.
    4.  **MEDIUM:** Algorithm and runtime optimizations.
    5.  **MEDIUM:** Infrastructure hardening and monitoring.
    6.  **LOW:** Documentation and maintenance procedures.

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
IMPORTANT NOTE: A clear and well-defined strategy is crucial for success. Rushing into implementation without a solid plan will result in wasted effort and potential system instability.
