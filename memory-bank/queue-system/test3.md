COMPREHENSIVE DUAL-MACHINE AI SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION & VALIDATION

Claude, execute a comprehensive optimization and validation audit of this dual-machine AI system with the following critical requirements:

SYSTEM CONTEXT:

77 total containerized agents (54 MainPC + 23 PC2)

MainPC: RTX 4090 with power GPU processing

PC2: RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM) hitting performance limits

Recent migration to individual containers per agent

Cross-machine ZMQ communication architecture

Critical performance bottlenecks and technical debt identified

PHASE 1 - CONTAINER VALIDATION & BUILD OPTIMIZATION:
1.0 MANDATORY SYSTEM DISCOVERY (RUN FIRST):

CRITICAL: Execute this before any other analysis!

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less

# Run the system discovery script to map the complete file structure

python system_discovery_script.py

# This will generate:

# - system_discovery_report.json (complete system mapping)

# - analysis_paths.json (specific file paths for analysis)

The background agent MUST start with system discovery to know exactly where all files are located!

1.1 SYSTEM DISCOVERY & CONTAINER ANALYSIS:

Complete File System Mapping:

code
Bash
