Analysis Summary
I've successfully analyzed the entire repository and identified 77 agents distributed across two machines:
MainPC (54 agents)
Foundation Services: 8 agents including ServiceRegistry, SystemDigitalTwin, RequestCoordinator
Memory System: 3 agents for memory management and knowledge storage
AI/Reasoning: 3 agents for cognitive processing and chain-of-thought
Language Processing: 10 agents for NLU, command handling, and response generation
Audio/Speech: 8 agents for real-time audio processing and TTS/STT
Emotion System: 6 agents for emotion processing and human awareness
Additional categories: Vision, Translation, GPU Infrastructure, Observability
PC2 (23 agents)
Infrastructure Core: 2 agents for monitoring and resource management
Memory Stack: 5 agents for memory orchestration and reasoning
Async Pipeline: 4 agents for task processing and routing
Vision & Dream GPU: 4 agents for vision processing and dream simulation
Utility Suite: 5 agents for file operations, authentication, and utilities
Specialized Services: 3 agents for web interface, tutoring, and error handling
