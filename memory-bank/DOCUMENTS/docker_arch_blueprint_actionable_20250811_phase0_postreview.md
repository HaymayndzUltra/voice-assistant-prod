# Phase 0 Post-Review â€” docker_arch_blueprint_actionable_20250811

Phase: PHASE 0: SETUP & PROTOCOL (READ FIRST)

IMPORTANT NOTE (from plan):
"Use GHCR with pinned tags (ghcr.io/<org>/<family>:YYYYMMDD-<git_sha>), non-root USER appuser, tini as PID 1, multi-stage builds, reproducible apt/pip with version locks and --require-hashes. GPU images target CUDA 12.1 with SM 8.9/8.6 and hardware-aware defaults via machine-profile.json."

Evidence of compliance for Phase 0 gates:
- Next-phase analyzer: IMPORTANT NOTE present; lint ok.
- Hierarchy viewer: Task visible with commands preview.
- Execution guide prepared: memory-bank/DOCUMENTS/docker_blueprint_actionable_20250811_step_by_step.md (phase-gated, includes GHCR tags and buildx cache usage).

Commands executed (read-only checks):
```
python3 plan_next.py
python3 plain_hier.py docker_arch_blueprint_actionable_20250811
```

Conclusion:
- Phase 0 protocol read and enforced; gating artifacts prepared. Ready to mark Phase 0 done.
