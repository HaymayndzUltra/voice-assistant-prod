# Phase 4 Post-Review — docker_arch_impl_20250810

Quoted IMPORTANT NOTE:

> IMPORTANT NOTE: This phase involves modifying the runtime of every service. Coordinate deployments carefully, especially for core infrastructure, to minimize downtime. Use the `FORCE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variable for targeted testing.

Evidence / How constraints were satisfied:
- Coordination / sequencing:
  - PC2 services (Sub-Phase 4.3) were migrated first and aligned to `pc2_code/config/startup_config.yaml` to reduce blast radius before main-PC changes.
  - See: `pc2_startup_config_alignment_report.md` (23/23 agents aligned; 14 extras removed; 5 missing added).
- Risk mitigations:
  - Port conflicts avoided via PC2 range discipline and explicit mappings; health checks standardized.
    Evidence: `pc2_migration_summary_report_tagalog.md` (explicit ports in 7100–9150; health 8100–9110).
  - ObservabilityHub containerized on PC2 for visibility before broader rollout.
    Evidence: alignment report lists `pc2_observability_hub` (prometheus 9100, health 9110).
  - Template standardization and minimal per-agent requirements to reduce image bloat and security surface.
    Evidence: migration summary “Template Standardization” and “Dependency Optimization”.
- Validation results:
  - PC2 migration execution: 74 agents containerized (49 Main-PC + PC2 set finalized to 23 per startup config), ZERO failures.
    Evidence: `pc2_migration_summary_report_tagalog.md` and `pc2_startup_config_alignment_report.md`.
  - Final state for PC2: 23/23 startup-config agents present with correct ports, envs (`PC2_ENVIRONMENT=true`), and health checks.

Confidence: 95%
