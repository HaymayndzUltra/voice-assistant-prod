Phase 3 Post-Review (organized_actionable_20250816)
Action: Ran `python3 verify_hub_inclusion.py`; regenerated `audits/proof_matrix.csv` and `audits/missing_or_weak.csv`.
Metrics: proof_total=14, exists_in_hub=true=0, missing_or_weak=14, commentout_candidates_rows=0.
Assessment: Proof metrics collected; no high-confidence exists_in_hub rows. Weak/missing proofs captured for review.
IMPORTANT NOTE satisfied: Verified proofs and identified weak/missing before proceeding.
