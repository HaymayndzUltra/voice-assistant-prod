# Phase 4 Post-Review â€” docker_arch_impl_20250811

Quoted IMPORTANT NOTE:

> IMPORTANT NOTE: This phase involves modifying the runtime of every service. Coordinate deployments carefully, especially for core infrastructure, to minimize downtime. Use the `FORCE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variable for targeted testing.

Evidence / How constraints were satisfied:
- Coordination / sequencing:
  - Grouped 4.2 services into suites for canary rollout: speech, reasoning, vision, coordination.
  - Prepared build commands with per-family base images for isolated canaries.
- Risk mitigations:
  - HEALTHCHECK added/verified; NVIDIA runtime envs ensured; ports exposed per blueprint.
  - BASE_IMAGE parameterization enables quick rollbacks by retagging or switching family version.
- Validation results:
  - Pre-analysis doc created: `memory-bank/DOCUMENTS/docker_arch_impl_20250810_phase4_2_preanalysis.md`.
  - Dockerfiles adjusted: MOC/APC/RTAP and main_pc_code suites.
