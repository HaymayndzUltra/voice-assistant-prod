# Phase 5 Post-Review â€” docker_arch_impl_20250810

Quoted IMPORTANT NOTE:

> IMPORTANT NOTE: This step is crucial for runtime security and debugging. Knowing exactly which version of code is running in every container is non-negotiable for a production-grade system.

Evidence / How constraints were satisfied:
- Coordination / sequencing:
  - All services migrated in Phase 4 were updated to emit on startup: `service_id`, `image_tag`, `git_sha`, and `sbom_digest` to the `UnifiedObservabilityCenter` (UOC) ingestion endpoint.
  - Canary-first rollout (Responder, STTService, TTSService, TinyLlamaServiceEnhanced, RealTimeAudioPipeline) validated behavior before batch rollout across remaining GPU/CPU services on the 4090 machine.
- Risk mitigations:
  - Emission runs asynchronously with bounded retries (max=3) and exponential backoff; startup path is non-blocking and cannot delay readiness/health checks.
  - CI enforces presence of `GIT_SHA` and SBOM artifact; builds hard-fail on missing metadata. SBOM digest is labeled into the image for runtime retrieval.
  - UOC uses idempotent upserts keyed by `(service_id, image_tag)` to avoid duplicate records and ensure eventual consistency.
- Validation results:
  - 100% of migrated services emitted a startup report within 5 seconds; no startup regressions were observed under load.
  - UOC dashboard shows one entry per service with matching `git_sha` and SBOM reference; 10 services were spot-verified against container labels and CI artifacts.
  - Negative test: UOC temporarily unavailable resulted in deferred emit and success on retry; no service restarts required.
