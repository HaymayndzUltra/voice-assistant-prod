# Phase 6 Post-Review — docker_arch_impl_20250810

Quoted IMPORTANT NOTE:

> IMPORTANT NOTE: This final phase ensures the project is not only complete but also maintainable and resilient. A well-documented rollback plan is a critical piece of operational readiness.

Evidence / How constraints were satisfied:
- Rollback tagging:
  - All last-known-good production images identified and tagged with `-prev` against immutable digests in GHCR. No originals altered or deleted.
  - Digest-pinned tagging verified via registry listing and pull tests.
- Runbook completeness:
  - `ROLLBACK_PROCEDURE.md` documents step-by-step rollback via `FORCE_IMAGE_TAG`, health verification, observability checks, and roll-forward steps.
  - Includes dependency matrix and coordinated rollback order to avoid version skew.
- Validation results:
  - Staging dry-runs for one GPU service and one CPU service: rollback completed within SLA, health checks remained green, and observability reflected version change.
  - Negative test validated safe failure modes (missing tag), with clear remediation guidance.

## Validation Checklist
- [x] `-prev` tags applied to all services’ last-known-good digests
- [x] Runbook covers rollback, validation, and roll-forward
- [x] Staging dry-runs completed for GPU and CPU representatives

## Evidence
- Registry verification log: `rollback/logs/ghcr_prev_tag_verification_2025-08-10.txt`
- Dry-run transcripts: `rollback/logs/staging_rollback_responder_gpu.txt`, `rollback/logs/staging_rollback_scheduler_cpu.txt`
- Runbook: `ROLLBACK_PROCEDURE.md`

## Confidence
Confidence: 95%
