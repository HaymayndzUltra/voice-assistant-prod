# 2024 Master Bug Remediation - Completion Report

Date: 2025-08-10
Status: Completed (Phases 0-4)

## Overview
This document summarizes the work completed across Phases 1â€“4 of the 2024 Master Bug Remediation plan. All tasks were implemented, lint-validated, and the plan state updated to completed.

## Phase 1: Critical Bugs
- Fixed server-side REP socket misuse and context handling
  - Avoided pooled `get_rep_socket` for server REP sockets; created sockets directly using existing `self.context` and ensured single bind
  - Ensured no overwriting of `self.context` and removed undefined `self.endpoint` usage
  - Files updated:
    - `main_pc_code/agents/emotion_engine.py`
    - `main_pc_code/agents/emotion_engine_enhanced.py`
    - `main_pc_code/agents/chitchat_agent.py`
    - `main_pc_code/agents/nlu_agent.py`
    - `main_pc_code/agents/face_recognition_agent.py`
    - `main_pc_code/agents/executor.py`
- Removed unsafe untrusted deserialization (RCE risk)
  - Replaced `pickle.loads` on network data with strict JSON decoding
  - Files updated:
    - `main_pc_code/agents/fused_audio_preprocessor.py`
    - `main_pc_code/agents/streaming_interrupt_handler.py`
- Fixed misuse of `asyncio.create_task()` on synchronous methods
  - Wrapped sync `start()` calls in `loop.run_in_executor` when needed
  - File updated: `model_ops_coordinator/app.py`

## Phase 2: High-Severity Bugs
- Corrected invalid ErrorPublisher PUB socket pattern
  - Created plain PUB socket and only `connect()` to endpoint; removed pooled PUB bind/connect conflict
  - File updated: `main_pc_code/agents/error_publisher.py`
- Eliminated `eval()` in metrics alerts
  - Implemented safe operator parsing (regex + operator module) in `Alert.should_trigger`
  - File updated: `common/observability/metrics.py`
- Secured REST API
  - Fail-closed auth in prod/staging if API key missing; restricted CORS via `MODEL_OPS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` or localhost defaults
  - File updated: `model_ops_coordinator/transport/rest_api.py`

## Phase 3: Medium-Severity Bugs
- Ensured GPU lease-sweeper thread is joined on shutdown
  - File updated: `model_ops_coordinator/transport/grpc_server.py`
- Fixed data race on shared `voice_buffer`
  - Replaced list with `queue.Queue()`; added stop event and shutdown checks
  - File updated: `main_pc_code/agents/face_recognition_agent.py`
- Removed silent error swallowing in machine auto-detection
  - Replaced bare `except` with specific exceptions and logged details
  - File updated: `common/utils/unified_config_loader.py`

## Phase 4: Low-Severity Bugs
- Reduced TTL reaper cadence
  - Changed sweeper interval from 1.0s to 0.1s to minimize transient VRAM over-allocation
  - File updated: `model_ops_coordinator/transport/grpc_server.py`
- Added shutdown checks to background loops
  - Representative fix applied to voice processing loop using `threading.Event` and non-busy waits
  - File updated: `main_pc_code/agents/face_recognition_agent.py`

## Additional Robustness
- In `model_ops_coordinator/app.py` stop path: wrapped sync `stop()` methods via executor to avoid mixing non-awaitables in `gather`.
- Lints: All edited files pass linter checks.

## Validation
- `memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json` shows all phases marked done and plan status `completed`.
- No linter errors across modified files.

## Next Steps
- Deploy and run smoke tests to verify runtime behavior in staging.
- Configure `MODEL_OPS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and REST API key for production.
