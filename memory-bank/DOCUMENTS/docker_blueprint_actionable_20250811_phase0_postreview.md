# Phase 0 Post-Review — docker_blueprint_actionable_20250811

## Quoted IMPORTANT NOTE (from Phase 0 text)
"This phase encodes the operating protocol and gating rules. All later phases must include an IMPORTANT NOTE and follow post-review + pre-analysis gates."

## Evidence of Compliance
- Gate docs created for Phase 0 completion:
  - This post-review: `memory-bank/DOCUMENTS/docker_blueprint_actionable_20250811_phase0_postreview.md`
  - Next-phase pre-analysis: `memory-bank/DOCUMENTS/docker_blueprint_actionable_20250811_phase1_preanalysis.md`
- Execution protocol: Only the `todo_manager.py` CLI will be used to modify task state; there will be no direct edits to `memory-bank/queue-system/tasks_active.json`.
- Sequential execution: We will proceed strictly in order (0 → 6), advancing only after each phase gate passes.
- State sync: Task state changes via the CLI trigger auto-sync; timestamps are maintained in Philippines time (UTC+8) per system settings.

## Verdict
PASS — Constraints satisfied. Proceed to mark Phase 0 done via the task manager CLI.
