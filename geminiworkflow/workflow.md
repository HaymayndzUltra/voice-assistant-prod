```

**Claude Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ Task completion status
- üìÅ List of files modified/created
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical errors (if any)
- üîç Ready for verification flag

### **PHASE 3: DUAL VERIFICATION**
```

## üö® CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **NON-NEGOTIABLES**
1. **Token Efficiency**: Use minimal reporting format always
2. **Dual Verification**: Background Agent must verify all work
3. **Context Preservation**: Include essential context in instructions
4. **Quality Control**: User maintains final approval authority
5. **Adaptive Planning**: Adjust strategy based on verification results
6. **EXPLICIT REPORTING FORMAT**: Always include specific reporting format in every task instruction
7. **TRUST VALIDATED PLANS**: Use provided plans as trusted blueprints, focus on implementation feasibility
8. **ONE TASK AT A TIME**: Never generate multiple tasks simultaneously - always adaptive generation

### **WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION**
- **Background Agent**: Focus on strategic planning and verification
- **Claude**: Focus on fast, accurate implementation
- **User**: Coordinate efficiently between agents
- **System**: Maintain quality while maximizing efficiency

### **CRITICAL NEW SESSION CONSIDERATIONS**
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Claude does NOT remember previous sessions or conversations. Each new session starts with no memory of:
- Previous workflow discussions
- Token-efficient reporting preferences
- Established formats and templates
- Project context and conventions

**SOLUTION**: Background Agent must ALWAYS include explicit reporting format instructions in every task, such as:
- Reference to this workflow document
- Specific format template
- Sample expected output format

**EXAMPLE INSTRUCTION FORMAT:**
```
REPORT FORMAT: Follow geminiworkflow/workflow.md token-efficient format:
‚úÖ [TASK_NAME]: [STATUS]
üìÅ Files: [list]
üìä Status: [brief status]
```

---

## üéØ FINAL DIRECTIVE

**MISSION**: Execute complex AI system development with maximum efficiency, minimal token usage, and comprehensive quality assurance through the strategic coordination of Background Agent intelligence and Claude execution capabilities.

**SUCCESS FORMULA**: Strategic Planning + Efficient Execution + Dual Verification = Optimal Results

**READY TO EXECUTE**: This workflow is optimized for Cursor Ultra capabilities and ready for immediate implementation.

## üîç **MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS PROCESS**

### **BEFORE GENERATING ANY TASKS:**

**1. CODEBASE MAPPING**
- Analyze current file structure and agent implementations
- Map plan requirements to actual codebase structure
- Identify specific files, directories, and configurations that need modification
- Understand current system architecture and dependencies

**2. IMPLEMENTATION FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT**
- Evaluate technical requirements for each plan component
- Identify potential implementation challenges or constraints
- Assess resource requirements and dependencies
- Flag technical considerations that may affect implementation

**3. EXECUTION STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT**
- Create detailed implementation pathway based on plan + codebase analysis
- Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and complexity
- Develop risk mitigation strategies for complex changes
- Plan testing and validation approaches

### **IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS REPORT FORMAT:**
```
üîç IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS REPORT:
üìã Plan Summary: [Brief overview of trusted plan to implement]
üéØ Current Codebase State: [What actually exists that needs modification]
üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements: [Specific implementation needs and constraints]

üîß Implementation Strategy: [Detailed execution approach]
‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Factors: [Potential challenges and mitigation strategies]
üí° Optimization Opportunities: [Additional improvements during implementation]
```

### **STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Trust the validated plan** - Use provided plan as authoritative blueprint
- **Focus on implementation feasibility** - Ensure technical requirements are met
- **Map to actual codebase** - Connect plan to real files and structure
- **Identify technical constraints** - Flag implementation challenges early
- **Think strategically** - Consider long-term implications of changes
