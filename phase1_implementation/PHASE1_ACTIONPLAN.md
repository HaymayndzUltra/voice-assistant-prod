# PHASE 2 CONSOLIDATION – ModelManagerSuite

**Objective:**  
Consolidate all legacy model management and orchestration agents into a unified ModelManagerSuite.  
All logic, error handling, imports, helpers, and API endpoints from the original agents must be preserved and fully integrated.  
Use a modular structure (submodules/classes) so that each legacy logic is traceable and testable after the merge.

---

## Agents to Consolidate

- List here all legacy model agents, for example:
  - ModelOrchestrator (`main_pc_code/agents/model_orchestrator.py`)
  - ModelRegistryAgent (`main_pc_code/agents/model_registry_agent.py`)
  - ModelLoaderAgent (`main_pc_code/agents/model_loader_agent.py`)
  - ModelHealthMonitor (`main_pc_code/agents/model_health_monitor.py`)
  - *[Add any other model-related agents here]*

- **Unified Target:**  
  - ModelManagerSuite (`phase2_implementation/consolidated_agents/model_manager_suite/model_manager_suite.py`)

---

## Instructions

1. **Lossless Merge:**
   - Import all logic, classes, and helpers from each legacy agent as submodules or classes.
   - Do NOT discard, rewrite, or drop any logic or error handling—retain everything.
   - Use wrappers/adapters if direct class merges cause conflicts.

2. **Preserve API and Patterns:**
   - All legacy endpoints/routes must be exposed as subroutes, sub-apps, or compatible API handlers for backward compatibility.
   - Retain all error handling, logging, and config patterns.

3. **Modular Structure:**
   - Structure the unified ModelManagerSuite so that each legacy agent’s logic is encapsulated and documented.
   - Use clear comments or docstrings to map legacy features into the new code.

4. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - Ensure all original agent logic is covered by tests (unit/integration as available).
   - Update or generate documentation mapping legacy agent features to the unified agent.

5. **Migration Scripts (if needed):**
   - If DB/schema/data changes are needed, generate migration scripts or adapters.

## Output Checklist

- [ ] ModelManagerSuite contains ALL logic, error handling, and imports from legacy model agents.
- [ ] Modular, maintainable structure—no duplicated or lost code.
- [ ] All legacy endpoints are exposed or mapped.
- [ ] Full backward compatibility and traceability.
- [ ] Documentation updated.

**IMPORTANT:**  
Walang logic, error handling, o import na dapat mawala o makalimutan. Bawat dating agent ay dapat may traceable na bahagi sa bagong ModelManagerSuite.
