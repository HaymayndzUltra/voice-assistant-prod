# PC2 Containerization Readiness Checklist

## System Architecture
- [x] Fixed circular dependencies in agent relationships
- [x] Organized agents into logical container groups
- [x] Defined container resource limits
- [x] Ensured proper service startup order via dependencies

## Container Configuration
- [x] Created container groups configuration (container_groups.yaml)
- [x] Updated Docker Compose with proper service definitions
- [x] Implemented container health checks
- [x] Defined network configuration for container communication

## Agent Standardization
- [x] Standardized all agents with consistent error reporting
- [x] Standardized health check implementation
- [x] Ensured consistent configuration loading
- [x] Fixed inheritance issues with BaseAgent

## Resource Management
- [x] Set appropriate memory limits for each container
- [x] Allocated CPU resources according to agent needs
- [x] Configured GPU access for containers requiring AI capabilities
- [x] Added volume mounts for persistent data

## Security
- [x] Separated sensitive configuration from images
- [x] Created separate networks for different security domains
- [x] Ensured proper permission settings
- [x] Protected sensitive APIs from external access

## Environment Configuration
- [x] Created environment variable templates
- [x] Ensured configuration can be loaded from environment variables
- [x] Implemented service discovery mechanism
- [x] Configured proper logging settings

## Networking
- [x] Exposed necessary ports for services
- [x] Created networks with proper subnets
- [x] Configured container DNS for service discovery
- [x] Set internal network for non-exposed services

## Monitoring
- [x] Implemented container health checks
- [x] Added logging volume mounts
- [x] Prepared monitoring endpoints
- [x] Created process supervisor in containers

## Pre-Launch Tasks
- [ ] Run agent validation to ensure all required dependencies are satisfied
- [ ] Perform end-to-end test with core service containers
- [ ] Validate error handling across container boundaries
- [ ] Create backup of current non-containerized system

## Deployment Scripts
- [x] Updated docker-compose files
- [x] Created container build scripts
- [ ] Created container deployment documentation
- [ ] Created rollback procedures

## Known Issues to Resolve
- [x] Fixed circular dependency between HealthMonitor → PerformanceMonitor → PerformanceLoggerAgent → SystemHealthManager → HealthMonitor
- [ ] Need to validate container network performance
- [ ] Test memory limits under peak load

## Containerization Confidence Score: 90%

The PC2 system is nearly ready for containerization with the majority of critical issues resolved:

✅ **Strengths**:
- Architecture dependencies have been resolved
- Agent code has been standardized
- Container configurations are complete
- Resource allocations are properly defined
- Network configuration is in place

⚠️ **Remaining Items**:
- Final validation testing needs to be performed
- Performance testing under load is required
- Deployment documentation needs to be completed
