## 📋 WORKFLOW TRIGGERS FOR CASCADE MEMORY MANAGEMENT

### 🚀 SESSION WORKFLOWS

#### 1. **session-start.md** - On New Session
**Trigger:** When Cascade starts new session
**Actions:**
- Load all memory contexts (MCP + memory-bank)
- Sync state files for consistency
- Initialize cursor_state.json 
- Check todo-tasks.json for active tasks
- Display current session status

#### 2. **session-end.md** - On Session End  
**Trigger:** When session terminates/disconnects
**Actions:**
- Save final cursor position and state
- Update task_interruption_state.json
- Append session summary to memory-bank
- Clean temporary files
- Prepare for next session resume

#### 3. **after-code-change.md** - After Code Modifications
**Trigger:** After significant file saves/edits
**Actions:**
- Update state file timestamps
- Increment task progress
- Store change summary in memory system
- Sync all state files
- Trigger auto-sync events

## 🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### On Session Start:
```bash
# Cascade automatically executes:
1. Read memory-bank/*.md files
2. Load MCP memory contexts  
3. Sync cursor_state.json
4. Check for interrupted tasks
5. Display current status
```

### During Development:
```bash
# After each significant change:
1. Update timestamps in state files
2. Store change summary in memory
3. Increment task progress
4. Maintain consistency
```

### On Session End:
```bash
# Before disconnection:
1. Save current position
2. Preserve interrupted task state
3. Update memory bank
4. Clean temporary files
```

## 🔧 STATE FILES MANAGED

### Primary State Files:
- **todo-tasks.json** - Source of truth for tasks
- **cursor_state.json** - Current session state
- **task-state.json** - Execution state
- **task_interruption_state.json** - Interrupted task data
- **memory-bank/current-session.md** - Session activity log

### Memory Sources:
- **MCP memory server** - Persistent memory storage
- **memory-bank/*.md** - Contextual documentation
- **State synchronization** - Cross-file consistency
