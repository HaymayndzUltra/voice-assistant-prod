UNIFIED-SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION PLAN
(for automated execution by an AI with ≤ 200 k context window)
============================================================
We will merge all MainPC + PC2 agents into one coherent architecture while preserving every critical capability.
The roadmap is broken into 3 logical phases—each fully self-contained and small enough for a single 200 k-token run.
Legend:
■ = previously identified essential agent □ = optional (on-demand) agent
PHASE 1 – FOUNDATION CONSOLIDATION
A. Objectives & Scope
Build a single source-of-truth (SSOT) configuration file (config/unified_startup.yaml) containing every agent from both machines.
Guarantee that the minimal conversational loop plus monitoring, memory, GPU, and coordinator services (all ■ agents) start successfully on one host cluster.
Replace all duplicated or legacy monitors with one ObservabilityHub instance.
Provide a topological start-order list and dependency map.
B. Step-by-Step Tasks
Copy main_pc_code/config/startup_config.yaml and pc2_code/config/startup_config.yaml → archive/ for rollback.
Draft config/unified_startup.yaml:
Create global_settings union (pick higher resource limits).
Insert core agents only (all ■ from prior report).
Point every dependencies: entry to the unified names; remove cross-machine prefixes.
Place ObservabilityHub at top; delete references to PerformanceMonitor, HealthMonitor, etc.
Write a startup script (scripts/launch_unified.py) that:
Reads YAML; performs dependency topological sort; spawns processes in correct ports.
Run automated smoke test: start, wait ≤ 120 s, verify all health endpoints return 200.
C. Expected Outputs / Results
unified_startup.yaml with 23 ± 2 agents (essential set).
Dependency graph (docs/unified_dependencies.svg).
Passing smoke-test log artifact (artifacts/phase1_smoke_ok.txt).
D. Acceptance / Review Criteria
✔ All ■ agents launch and reply to /health within SLA.
✔ No missing/duplicate ports.
✔ ObservabilityHub shows metrics for every running agent.
✔ CI job test_phase1_foundation passes.


■ = keep (core) □ = optional / postpone ⊗ = remove / deprecated
MAIN PC (keep 15 / 54)
Core Platform
■ ServiceRegistry
■ SystemDigitalTwin
■ ObservabilityHub (single monitoring endpoint)
Scheduling / Coordination
■ RequestCoordinator
■ ModelManagerSuite (model loading / VRAM gatekeeper)
■ VRAMOptimizerAgent
Memory Stack
■ MemoryClient
■ SessionMemoryAgent
■ KnowledgeBase
Speech I/O (minimum conversational loop)
■ AudioCapture
■ FusedAudioPreprocessor
■ StreamingSpeechRecognition
■ StreamingTTSAgent
■ STTService
■ TTSService
OPTIONAL CLUSTERS
□ Reasoning (ChainOfThoughtAgent, etc.)
□ Learning & Self-training suite
□ Vision, Emotion, Proactive agents
□ CodeGenerator, Executor, TranslationService, Tiny Llama, etc.
PC-2 (keep 8 / 23)
Core Platform
■ ObservabilityHub (pc2 scope)
■ MemoryOrchestratorService
■ ResourceManager
■ AsyncProcessor
Knowledge / Context
■ ContextManager
■ UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent
Application-specific
■ TieredResponder (primary response service)
■ TaskScheduler
OPTIONAL CLUSTERS
□ DreamWorldAgent, DreamingModeAgent
□ VisionProcessingAgent (only if PC-2 camera required)
□ Tutor / Tutoring agents, UnifiedWebAgent, etc.
⊗ Duplicated / deprecated monitors (PerformanceMonitor, HealthMonitor, etc.)
C. OPTIMAL START-UP SEQUENCE
Dependencies resolved left→right.
Infrastructure & Registry
1.1 ServiceRegistry → 1.2 ObservabilityHub → 1.3 SystemDigitalTwin
Coordination / Resource Control
2.1 ModelManagerSuite → 2.2 VRAMOptimizerAgent → 2.3 RequestCoordinator
Memory Foundation
3.1 MemoryClient → 3.2 KnowledgeBase → 3.3 SessionMemoryAgent
Speech I/O Loop
4.1 AudioCapture → 4.2 FusedAudioPreprocessor → 4.3 STTService
4.4 StreamingSpeechRecognition → 4.5 TTSService → 4.6 StreamingTTSAgent
(PC-2)
5.1 ObservabilityHub-PC2 → 5.2 MemoryOrchestratorService → 5.3 ResourceManager
5.4 AsyncProcessor → 5.5 ContextManager → 5.6 UnifiedMemoryReasoningAgent
5.7 TaskScheduler → 5.8 TieredResponder
⟶ All remaining optional agents load on-demand via dynamic launcher once core is healthy.
D. HYBRID LLM ROUTING STRATEGY
• Heavy compute: delegate to cloud LLM (large-context reasoning, code-gen, training).
Triggered by RequestCoordinator when task.complexity > threshold
Lightweight tasks: use on-premise local LLM (NLU, short replies) via StreamingTTS/ STT pair.
ObservabilityHub records per-task latency → feedback to ModelManagerSuite to refine routing threshold.
Fail-over: if cloud LLM unreachable, fallback to local; if VRAM exhausted, gracefully degrade to smaller quantised model (TinyLlama/TinyMix).
E. SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Explicit required flags: mark only “■” agents true; others false or conditional.
Consolidate monitoring: ensure all agents reference ObservabilityHub; purge legacy monitors.
Introduce lazy loader: orchestrator that spawns optional clusters when first requested.
Health-check back-pressure: VRAMOptimizerAgent can instruct RequestCoordinator to queue jobs.
Configuration-as-code: generate derived minimal YAML per deployment profile (speech-only, vision-enabled, tutoring, etc.).


==================== REPORT NG AI====================

==================== UTOS NG USER ====================

PHASE 2 – FUNCTIONAL PARITY & INTEGRATION
A. Objectives & Scope
Re-introduce all □ (optional) agents in deferred-load mode without breaking the stable core.
Implement Hybrid LLM Routing (local vs. cloud) inside ModelManagerSuite.
Finish cross-component harmonisation: memory, context, tutoring, reasoning, vision, emotion, etc.
B. Step-by-Step Tasks
Extend YAML: append each □ agent under the correct logical group with required: false and a new field autoload: on_demand.
Add LazyLoader service (new agent) that watches RequestCoordinator events and spawns any unloaded optional agent when first referenced.
Patch ModelManagerSuite:
Add select_backend(task_meta)
 – chooses local_llm or cloud_llm.
Expose metrics to ObservabilityHub.
Migrate remaining PC2-only services:
Prefix names with unique identifiers to avoid clashes (e.g., TieredResponder already unique).
Update any hard-coded hostnames → use env var UNIFIED_HOST.
Expand integration tests: scenario-based activation of LazyLoader (vision request, tutoring session, etc.).
Validate GPU allocator (VRAMOptimizerAgent) handles dynamic arrivals.
C. Expected Outputs / Results
Updated YAML containing all 77 agents.
LazyLoader code & unit tests.
Hybrid routing algorithm integrated and benchmark report (artifacts/routing_benchmark.md).
End-to-end functional test suite (tests/e2e_full/).
D. Acceptance / Review Criteria
✔ Optional agents stay dormant until invoked; spin-up time ≤ 30 s.
✔ Routing selects cloud for ≥95 % “heavy” tasks in benchmark.
✔ No GPU OOM events during marathon test (4 h).
✔ ObservabilityHub dashboards include optional agents after load.

============================================================
NOTES ON DEPENDENCIES & REFERENCES
============================================================
Every phase ships a dependency map (graphviz file) matching the agents present in that phase.
Port collisions prevented by single contiguous range 7200-7999 (agents) and 8200-8999 (health).
All agents reference one ObservabilityHub via env OBS_HUB_ENDPOINT.
Code checkpoints kept per-phase branch (phase1_foundation, phase2_integration, …) to ensure rollback with no loss of functionality.

   - Gumawa ng standard folder hierarchy (e.g., /src, /config, /scripts, /docs, /tests, etc.).
   - Ihiwalay ang configuration files at secrets (gamitin ang best practices tulad ng .env at .gitignore).
   - Ilagay ang documentation (README.md at setup guides).
   - Mag-setup ng initial CI/CD config (optional: basic pipeline o instruction para sa automation).
   - I-link ang usage guides para madaling onboarding ng susunod na dev/AI agent.
4. Siguraduhin na updated lahat ng dependencies at merong compatibility checks kung kailangan.
5. Maglagay ng validation scripts o basic test cases para masiguradong gumagana after migration.
6. **Itest muna nang buo ang bagong repository at components. Siguraduhin na lahat ng features, scripts, at configs ay working ng walang error bago magbigay ng final report o folder structure.**
7. Ibigay ang listahan ng laman ng bagong repository (folder/file structure), pati short description ng bawat main component.
8. Magbigay ng final checklist bago ideclare na ready for deployment or hand-off sa automation.

NOTES:
- Mag-suggest ng improvements sa structure o process kung may makita kang posibleng optimization.
- I-flag agad kung may missing critical component o potential issue para ma-address bago i-finalize.
- Optional: Kung may dependencies na kailangan pang i-install/initialize, ilista ang exact steps o commands.

OUTPUT:
- Complete, organized folder structure (list/tree)
- Short description per main component/folder
