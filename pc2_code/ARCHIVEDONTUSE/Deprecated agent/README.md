# Deprecated Agents Folder

All agents and modules that are no longer needed, have been merged, or are superseded by consolidated logic are moved here for archival and safety. Review before permanent deletion.

## Guidelines:
- Only move agents that are fully replaced or redundant.
- Ensure no active process or port conflict before moving.
- Update documentation and inventory after every move.
