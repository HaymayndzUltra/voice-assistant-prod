  - Processes text sentence by sentence for immediate playback
  - Supports both XTTS and pyttsx3 fallback
  - Implements caching for frequently used phrases
  - Allows for immediate interruption of speech
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses the same ZMQ port (5562) as the original TTS agent for compatibility
  - Implements audio queue system for smooth playback
  - Splits text into sentences for streaming processing

### 3. Streaming Interrupt Handler
- **New Module**: `streaming_interrupt_handler.py`
- **Purpose**: Monitors partial transcripts for interruption keywords and sends interrupt signals
- **Benefits**:
  - Detects interruptions in both English and Tagalog
  - Sends immediate stop commands to the TTS agent
  - Broadcasts interrupt signals to all modules
- **Technical Details**:
  - Subscribes to partial transcripts on port 5575
  - Publishes interrupt signals on port 5576
  - Directly connects to TTS agent for immediate stop commands
  - Implements cooldown to prevent duplicate interrupts

### 4. Enhanced Silence Detection
- **Updated Module**: `streaming_speech_recognition.py`
- **Purpose**: Faster processing of short phrases with intelligent silence detection
- **Benefits**:
  - Immediately processes speech after short pauses (0.8s)
  - Prevents double-processing of commands
  - Natural end-of-speech detection for both short and long utterances
- **Technical Details**:
  - Reduced minimum transcribe buffer to 1.0 second (from 2.0 seconds)
  - Audio level tracking for silence detection
  - Automatic extension of listening window during continuous speech
  - Special handling of silence to trigger immediate processing

### 5. Wake Word Detection
- **New Modules**: `threshold_wakeword.py` and `wakeword_detector.py`
- **Purpose**: Allow system to remain silent until activated
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces false activations from background noise
  - Improves privacy by only processing audio after activation
  - Provides two implementation options
- **Technical Details**:
  - Threshold-based approach (simple audio activity detection)
  - Optional Porcupine-based specific wake words (jarvis, computer, etc.)
  - Dedicated ZMQ port (5590) for wake word detection
  - Integration with streaming_audio_capture.py in wake word mode

### 6. Enhanced Translation Auto-correction
- **Updated Module**: `streaming_translation.py`
- **Purpose**: Improve Tagalog-to-English translation accuracy
- **Benefits**:
  - Extensive dictionary of common phrases and patterns
  - Comprehensive pattern-based corrections
  - Track specific corrections with detailed reporting
- **Technical Details**:
  - Dictionary of common Tagalog phrases and their corrected English versions
  - Pattern-based correction system using regular expressions
  - Detailed logging of applied corrections
  - Integration with testing tools for correction verification

### 7. Distributed NLLB LLM Translation Integration
- **New Modules**: `fixed_streaming_translation.py` and `llm_translation_adapter.py`
- **Purpose**: Use NLLB on PC2 for enhanced translation quality with fallback mechanisms
- **Benefits**:
  - Context-aware translations using distributed processing
  - Better handling of idioms and code-switching
  - Reduced load on main PC by offloading translation to PC2
  - Robust fallback mechanisms when PC2 connection is unavailable
- **Technical Details**:
  - ZMQ REQ/REP pattern for communication between Main PC and PC2
  - PC2 (192.168.1.2) hosts the LLM translation adapter on port 5581
  - Main PC connects to PC2 for translation requests
  - Fallback to dictionary-based translation if PC2 is unavailable
  - Custom prompt template for translation optimization
  - Direct Ollama API integration on PC2
  - JSON-formatted responses with translation metrics and source tracking

## Performance Improvements

These optimizations address the key recommendations for reducing latency and improving the real-time responsiveness of the voice assistant system:

1. **Reduced Latency**: The streaming partial transcripts and improved silence detection provide immediate feedback while full processing continues in the background.

2. **More Natural Interaction**: The streaming TTS allows for sentence-by-sentence playback, creating a more natural conversation flow.

3. **Improved Responsiveness**: The interrupt handler enables immediate stopping of speech when the user wants to interrupt.

4. **Enhanced User Experience**: The combined optimizations create a more fluid and responsive voice assistant experience.

5. **Better Translation Quality**: The enhanced auto-correction and NLLB integration significantly improve Tagalog-to-English translations.

6. **Privacy Improvements**: Wake word detection ensures the system only processes speech when specifically activated.

## Testing Results

The optimized pipeline has been tested with the following scenarios:

1. **Speech Pipeline Test**: Verified that the full pipeline processes speech input correctly with faster response times for short phrases.

2. **Streaming TTS Test**: Confirmed that the TTS agent processes text sentence by sentence for immediate playback.

3. **Interruption Test**: Validated that the system can immediately stop speech output when interrupted.

4. **Wake Word Detection Test**: Confirmed the system only processes audio after activation phrases.

5. **Translation Auto-correction Test**: Verified improved Tagalog-to-English translation accuracy with auto-correction.

All tests showed successful operation of the optimized pipeline, with noticeable improvements in responsiveness, translation quality, and user experience.

## Next Steps

1. **Manage Agents on PC2**: Optimize PC2 agent allocation to save RAM and improve performance.

2. **Fix Dashboard Agent Registration**: Resolve issues with agents showing "Unknown" status in the dashboard.

3. **Session Management**: Implement improved context handling for multi-turn conversations.

4. **Performance Metrics**: Implement monitoring to measure and track latency improvements across system components.
