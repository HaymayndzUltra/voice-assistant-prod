# PC2 Containerization Final Checklist

## Pre-Containerization Setup
- [x] Checked all PC2 agents for standardized patterns
- [x] Fixed circular dependencies in agent relationships
- [x] Created Docker-optimized memory usage solutions
- [x] Created comprehensive .dockerignore file

## Container Optimization
- [x] Used multi-stage Docker builds to reduce image size
- [x] Implemented memory monitoring and garbage collection
- [x] Added memory limits to all containers
- [x] Created tmpfs mounts for temporary files
- [x] Set read-only mounts for model directories

## LLM Model Management
- [x] Created dedicated LLM model manager for downloading and optimization
- [x] Implemented model quantization (4-bit for LLMs)
- [x] Added model pruning to remove unnecessary files
- [x] Set up optimized translation model conversion

## Docker Environment Cleanup
- [x] Created script to clean up unused Docker resources
- [x] Added Docker system check script to verify readiness
- [x] Created comprehensive rebuild script for complete system reset
- [x] Made all maintenance scripts executable

## Final Pre-Launch Steps
1. Run the Docker check script:
   ```bash
   cd docker/pc2
   ./docker_check.sh
   ```

2. Clean up existing Docker resources:
   ```bash
   ./cleanup_docker.sh
   ```

3. Rebuild and start the optimized containers:
   ```bash
   ./rebuild_all.sh
   ```

4. Verify system is running properly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.enhanced.yml ps
   ```

## Memory Usage Monitoring

After deployment, monitor memory usage:

```bash
docker stats
```

Expected memory usage pattern:
- core-infrastructure: ~800-900MB
- redis: ~300-400MB
- memory-system: ~1.5-1.8GB
- ai-models: ~2.5-3.5GB with GPU offloading
- user-services: ~1.2-1.4GB
- ai-monitoring: ~1.5-1.8GB
- translation-services: ~1.2-1.5GB

Total system memory usage should be 9-10GB in normal operation, compared to the previous 250GB.
