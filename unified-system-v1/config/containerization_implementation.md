# PC2 System Containerization Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of containerization for the PC2 system using Podman. The system has been organized into logical container groups based on agent functionality and dependencies as defined in the `startup_config_fixed.yaml` file.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Container Structure

The PC2 system has been containerized with the following structure:

- **Base Image**: A common base image with shared dependencies
- **Container Groups**: Seven specialized containers for different agent types
  - Core Infrastructure
  - Memory & Storage
  - Security & Authentication
  - Integration & Communication
  - Monitoring & Support
  - Dream & Tutoring
  - Web & External Services

### 2. Files Created

The following files have been created for containerization:

#### Dockerfiles
- `pc2_code/docker/Dockerfile.base` - Base image with common dependencies
- `pc2_code/docker/Dockerfile.core_infrastructure` - Core infrastructure container
- `pc2_code/docker/Dockerfile.memory_storage` - Memory & storage container
- (And similar Dockerfiles for other container groups)

#### Requirements Files
- `pc2_code/docker/requirements.common.txt` - Common Python dependencies
- `pc2_code/docker/requirements.core_infrastructure.txt` - Core infrastructure dependencies
- `pc2_code/docker/requirements.memory_storage.txt` - Memory & storage dependencies
- (And similar requirements files for other container groups)

#### Scripts
- `pc2_code/scripts/start_container.py` - Python script to start agents within containers
- `pc2_code/scripts/health_check.py` - Python script for container health monitoring
- `pc2_code/docker/build_images.sh` - Shell script to build all container images
- `pc2_code/docker/start_containers.sh` - Shell script to start all containers
- `pc2_code/docker/stop_containers.sh` - Shell script to stop all containers

#### Configuration
- `pc2_code/docker/podman-compose.yaml` - Podman Compose file for container orchestration

### 3. Key Implementation Details

#### Container Organization

Agents have been grouped into containers based on:
- Functional similarity
- Dependency relationships
- Resource requirements

#### Health Checks

Each container includes:
- Internal agent health checks via HTTP/ZMQ
- Container-level health monitoring
- Automatic restart of failed agents

#### Networking

- All containers connect to a shared `pc2-network`
- Inter-container communication via service names
- Port mapping for external access

#### Volume Mounts

- `/app/logs` - For log files
- `/app/config` - For configuration files
- `/app/data` - For persistent data

### 4. Startup and Shutdown

The containerized system can be managed with:
- `./pc2_code/docker/build_images.sh` - Build all images
- `./pc2_code/docker/start_containers.sh` - Start all containers
- `./pc2_code/docker/stop_containers.sh` - Stop all containers

### 5. Corrections Made

During implementation, the following corrections were made:

- Removed `SystemDigitalTwin` from PC2 configuration as it should only be on main_pc
- Fixed circular dependencies in agent startup order
- Ensured proper script paths in configuration files
- Added proper health check implementations

## Usage Instructions

### Building Images

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x pc2_code/docker/build_images.sh

# Run the script from the project root
./pc2_code/docker/build_images.sh
```

### Starting Containers

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x pc2_code/docker/start_containers.sh

# Run the script from the project root
./pc2_code/docker/start_containers.sh
```

### Stopping Containers

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x pc2_code/docker/stop_containers.sh

# Run the script from the project root
./pc2_code/docker/stop_containers.sh
```

### Checking Container Status

```bash
# Check container status
podman ps

# View logs for a specific container
podman logs -f pc2-core-infrastructure
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container fails to start**
   - Check container logs: `podman logs pc2-<container-name>`
   - Verify volume mounts and permissions
   - Check for port conflicts

2. **Agent health check failures**
   - Check agent logs in `/app/logs`
   - Verify agent configuration
   - Check network connectivity between containers

3. **Network connectivity issues**
   - Ensure `pc2-network` exists: `podman network ls`
   - Check container IP addresses: `podman inspect <container-name> | grep IPAddress`
   - Verify firewall settings

### Debugging

For detailed debugging:

```bash
# Enter a running container
podman exec -it pc2-<container-name> /bin/bash

# Check container environment
podman exec pc2-<container-name> env

# View container resource usage
podman stats pc2-<container-name>
```
