### Production Deployment Architecture

#### Primary Instance (main_pc)
```yaml
Container: rtap-main
Ports:
  - 6552: ZMQ Events
  - 6553: ZMQ Transcripts (primary output)
  - 5802: WebSocket
  - 8080: Health check
Resources:
  - Memory: 2GB limit, 512MB reserved
  - CPU: 2.0 cores limit, 0.5 reserved
Configuration: main_pc.yaml (GPU optimized)
```

#### Standby Instance (pc2)
```yaml
Container: rtap-standby
Ports:
  - 7552: ZMQ Events (standby)
  - 7553: ZMQ Transcripts (standby)
  - 6802: WebSocket (standby)
  - 8081: Health check (standby)
Resources:
  - Memory: 1GB limit, 256MB reserved
  - CPU: 1.0 core limit, 0.25 reserved
Configuration: pc2.yaml (CPU optimized)
```

#### Monitoring Stack
```yaml
Services:
  - Prometheus: Port 9090 (metrics)
  - Grafana: Port 3000 (dashboards)
  - Loki: Port 3100 (logs)
Features:
  - Real-time performance monitoring
  - Alerting on key metrics
  - Log aggregation and analysis
```

### Downstream Agent Compatibility

#### ZMQ Output Verification
- **Port 6553**: Primary transcript output
- **Port 7553**: Standby transcript output
- **Message format**: JSON with Pydantic schema validation
- **Topic filtering**: `transcript.{language}` for routing
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintained with legacy agents

#### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Deploy RTAP alongside legacy agents
2. **Phase 2**: Route subset of traffic to RTAP
3. **Phase 3**: Gradually increase RTAP traffic share
4. **Phase 4**: Full cutover to RTAP
5. **Phase 5**: Decommission legacy agents

### Operational Readiness

#### Monitoring & Alerting
```yaml
Key Metrics:
  - End-to-end latency < 150ms p95
  - Memory growth < 5% per hour
  - CPU utilization < 20% per core
  - Buffer overflow rate < 0.1%
  - Zero unhandled exceptions

Alert Thresholds:
  - Critical: Latency > 200ms, Service down > 30s
  - Warning: Memory growth > 10%, CPU > 50%
  - Info: High throughput, configuration changes
```

#### Health Checks
```bash
# Container health
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs rtap-main
/app/healthcheck.sh

# Service health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8081/health

# Performance monitoring
http://localhost:3000  # Grafana dashboards
http://localhost:9090  # Prometheus metrics
```

#### Backup & Recovery
```yaml
Configuration:
  - Volume mounts for persistent config
  - Immutable container configuration
  - Configuration versioning

Data:
  - No persistent audio data (by design)
  - Metrics retention: 7 days
  - Log retention: Configurable

Recovery:
  - Automatic container restart
  - Failover to standby instance
  - Configuration rollback capability
```

### Security Validation

#### Container Security
- ✅ Non-root user execution
- ✅ Minimal base image (Python 3.11 slim)
- ✅ No unnecessary privileges
- ✅ Network isolation via Docker networks

#### Network Security
- ✅ Services bind to localhost/container networks
- ✅ No external API exposure
- ✅ Port isolation and access controls
- ✅ ZMQ/WebSocket protocol security

#### Data Security
- ✅ No persistent audio storage
- ✅ In-memory processing only
- ✅ Secure inter-service communication
- ✅ Log sanitization

### Performance Validation

#### Latency Benchmarks
```
