  - Phase 1: System Analysis & Cleanup
        - Inventory all existing Docker/Podman containers, images, and compose files.
        - Delete all old containers/images/compose files.
        - Identify all agent groups, dependencies, and required libraries.
    - Phase 2: Logical Grouping & Compose Generation
        - Design optimal container groupings (by function, dependency, resource needs).
        - Generate new docker-compose SoT with correct build contexts, volumes, networks, and healthchecks.
        - Ensure requirements.txt per container is minimal and correct.
    - Phase 3: Validation & Optimization
        - Build and start all containers in dependency-correct order.
        - Validate agent startup, health, and inter-container communication.
        - Optimize for image size, startup time, and resource usage.
        - Document the new architecture and compose setup.
