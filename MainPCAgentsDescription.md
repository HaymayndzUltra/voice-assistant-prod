All explanations below are for non-technical users. Grouped by system area. Each agent:

Description: Simple summary

Analogy: Real-world job/role

Example: Simple use-case

FOUNDATION SERVICES

ServiceRegistry

Description: A simple directory that keeps track of where other agents are running and how to reach them.

Analogy: Like a receptionist who knows which department is in which room.

Example: When a new service starts, it “checks in” with the receptionist. Later, another agent asks the receptionist for the address of the text-to-speech service.

SystemDigitalTwin

Description: Monitors hardware performance (memory, CPU, etc.), predicts the impact of actions, and acts as a central registry.

Analogy: Similar to a control tower monitoring planes and simulating what happens if another plane lands.

Example: Before loading a large speech model, the system checks with the control tower to ensure enough memory is available and to simulate the impact on other services.

RequestCoordinator

Description: Routes and prioritizes incoming tasks, coordinating between agents; errors are sent through a central error bus.

Analogy: Like a dispatcher directing calls to the correct service and reporting issues.

Example: When the user asks to “play music,” the dispatcher forwards the request to the appropriate music handler and logs any errors.

ModelManagerSuite

Description: Manages machine-learning models: loads/unloads, tracks status, predicts which models may be needed soon, and evaluates performance.

Analogy: Like a librarian who fetches, shelves and monitors popular books.

Example: When the system needs text-to-speech, the librarian loads the voice model into memory and later unloads it when not in use.

VRAMOptimizerAgent

Description: Monitors graphics-card memory (VRAM), predicts model usage, and decides when to load or unload models.

Analogy: Like a parking attendant who monitors parking spaces and decides which cars can stay or must leave.

Example: When a new large-language model is requested, the attendant checks if there’s space and unloads unused models to make room.

ObservabilityHub

Description: Collects performance data, predicts issues, manages agent life cycles, and recovers services across multiple machines.

Analogy: Like a building’s control room watching all sensors and ensuring systems run smoothly.
