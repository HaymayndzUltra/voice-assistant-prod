# SOT Branch: Comprehensive Audit Cleanup 2025

## 🎯 BRANCH PURPOSE
This is the **Single Source of Truth (SOT)** branch containing the latest system state and comprehensive audit instructions for MainPC and PC2 cleanup operations.

## 📋 CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

### ✅ COMPLETED WORK
1. **Configuration Analysis**
   - MainPC: 52 configured agents, 15+ missing from config
   - PC2: 15 configured agents, properly corrected configuration
   - Phase 1 consolidation properly documented

2. **Audit Instructions Enhanced**
   - Location: `main_pc_code/config/audit.md`
   - Comprehensive MainPC + PC2 coverage
   - Security audit requirements added
   - Dependency mapping specifications
   - Phase 1 consolidation context included

3. **Configuration Corrections**
   - PC2: `pc2_code/config/startup_config_corrected.yaml` (88% confidence)
   - MainPC: `main_pc_code/config/startup_config_complete.yaml` (current)

### 🔍 KEY DISCOVERIES
- **PC2**: Had 28 actual agents but only 8 properly configured
- **MainPC**: Has 15+ major unconfigured agents (request_coordinator, system_digital_twin, etc.)
- **Phase 1**: 6 consolidated services implemented and ready
- **Cleanup Potential**: Significant number of ghost/unused agents identified

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS FOR BACKGROUND AGENT

### 📖 READ FIRST
1. `main_pc_code/config/audit.md` - Complete audit instructions
2. This SOT summary for context
3. Configuration files for current system state

### 🔧 EXECUTE AUDIT
Follow the comprehensive audit instructions in `audit.md`:
1. **PHASE 1: DISCOVERY** - Scan both MainPC and PC2
2. **PHASE 2: CLASSIFICATION** - Categorize all agents
3. **PHASE 3: ANALYSIS** - Dependencies and security scan
4. **PHASE 4: RECOMMENDATIONS** - Generate cleanup plan

### 📊 EXPECTED DELIVERABLES
- Comprehensive audit report with tables
- Safe-to-delete agent list
- Security vulnerability report  
- Dependency conflict identification
- Risk-assessed cleanup recommendations

## 🔥 CRITICAL FOCUS AREAS

### MainPC Issues to Address
- 15+ unconfigured major agents
- Missing core services (request_coordinator, system_digital_twin)
- Incomplete GPU management (vram_optimizer_agent)
- Missing health monitoring (predictive_health_monitor)

### PC2 Cleanup Opportunities  
- Agents consolidated into Phase 1 services (safe to delete)
- Archive directories needing cleanup
- Cross-system dependency optimization

### Security Priorities
- Scan for hardcoded credentials
- Identify insecure configurations
- Flag high-risk legacy code

## 🛡️ SAFETY REQUIREMENTS
- **Conservative approach**: False positive better than false negative
- **Dependency verification**: Triple-check before recommending deletion
- **Phase 1 context**: Respect consolidation mappings
- **Backup strategy**: Archive before delete
