## 🚀 FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE

### 🔍 Phase-Based Testing Approach

The framework consists of 4 comprehensive phases:

```
📋 PHASE 1: Comprehensive Docker Group Analysis
├── Analyze all 19 Docker groups and configurations
├── Validate startup dependencies and resource requirements  
├── Test Docker builds and port availability
└── Generate dependency graphs and startup orders

📋 PHASE 2: Local PC2 Validation
├── Test PC2 services locally on Main PC
├── Identify and resolve port conflicts
├── Validate resource capacity and agent scripts
└── Assess sync readiness criteria

📋 PHASE 3: Cross-Machine Sync Validation  
├── Pre-sync system health validation
├── Network connectivity and communication testing
├── Data consistency and backup verification
└── Sync readiness assessment with GO/NO-GO decision

📋 PHASE 4: Bulletproof Post-Sync Validation
├── Complete system health verification (10 sub-phases)
├── Service availability and cross-machine communication
├── Integration pathway testing and performance validation
├── Load testing, failover scenarios, and security validation
└── Final certification with production readiness assessment
```

### 🎯 Intelligent Orchestration

- **Evidence-Based Validation:** All tests provide measurable confidence scores
- **Dependency-Aware:** Phases execute based on prerequisite success
- **Parallel Execution:** Maximum efficiency through concurrent testing
- **Adaptive Thresholds:** Dynamic pass/fail criteria based on criticality
