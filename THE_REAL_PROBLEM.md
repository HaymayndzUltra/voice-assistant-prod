# üö® THE REAL PROBLEM - Images Don't Have App Code!

## ‚ùå What's Actually Happening:

1. **Images exist in GHCR** ‚úÖ (That's why pull works)
2. **But containers keep restarting** ‚ùå
3. **Why?** The images were built WITHOUT the actual Python application code!

## üîç How to Confirm:

Run this to see what's wrong:
```bash
bash DIAGNOSE_STARTUP_ISSUE.sh
```

You'll likely see:
- No `app.py` in `/app` directory
- Or missing Python modules
- Or wrong startup command

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION:

### Option 1: Quick WSL2 Fix (Try First)
```bash
git pull
bash WSL2_FIX_DEPLOYMENT.sh
```
This removes the `/dev/snd` requirement that doesn't exist in WSL2.

### Option 2: If Containers Still Fail - REBUILD
```bash
# The images need to be rebuilt with the actual code!
bash AUTOMATED_MAINPC_CRON.sh
```

## üéØ Root Cause:

The Dockerfiles likely have issues:
1. Missing `COPY . /app` or wrong COPY paths
2. Missing `requirements.txt` installation
3. Wrong `CMD` pointing to non-existent files

## üìù Quick Test:

Check if app.py exists in the image:
```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint ls \
  ghcr.io/haymayndzultra/ai_system/model_ops_coordinator:20250812-576dfae \
  -la /app
```

If `/app` is empty or missing `app.py`, that's the problem!

## üîß Immediate Actions:

1. **First:** Run `WSL2_FIX_DEPLOYMENT.sh` (fixes audio issue)
2. **Then:** Run `DIAGNOSE_STARTUP_ISSUE.sh` (shows what's wrong)
3. **Finally:** If needed, rebuild with `AUTOMATED_MAINPC_CRON.sh`

**WSL2 Note:** You're on Windows Subsystem for Linux, which doesn't have:
- `/dev/snd` (audio device)
- Full GPU passthrough (might affect CUDA)
- Some Linux kernel features

Consider running on actual Linux for production!
